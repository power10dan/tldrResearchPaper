# TL;DR My Research Papers, Please? 
This is an app that provides a tl;dr summary for each section of a research paper. The idea behind this app is extremely simple: to be able to provide
summaries for each section of the research paper that the user is reading, and minimize the amount of time they have to read research papers while maximizing their knowledge gain!
The app is still in development. Some of the technologies we used include Redux, ReactJS, and  Django JWT token authentication.
