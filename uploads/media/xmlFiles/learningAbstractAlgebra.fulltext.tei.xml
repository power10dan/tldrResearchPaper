<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>"Mathematics is the science of order, patterns, structure, and logical relationships." <ref type="bibr">(Devlin, 2000, p. 74)</ref> In a compelling new book The Math Gene, renowned mathematician, expositor, and National Public <ref type="bibr">Radio commentator Keith Devlin (2000)</ref> claims that everyone has innate ability to do mathematics because "the features of the brain that enable us to do mathematics are the very same features that enable us to use language" (p. 2). A key point in his argument is that richer representation rather than richer communication was the driving force behind the emergence of language.</p><p>In order to properly understand how we acquired language, we should view it as a representational structure rather than as a medium of communication. In order to communicate some concept, you first need to have a mental representation of it. <ref type="bibr">(p. 291)</ref> His argument draws on a broad body of empirical and theoretical work in anthropology, neuroscience, linguistics, psychology, mathematics education, and also upon his contention that most people do not know what mathematics is. "Modern mathematics," he claims, "is about abstract patterns, abstract structures, and abstract relationships" (p. 136). And with a sufficiently broad understanding of "pattern," the shorter version "the science of patterns" says it all (pp. 73-74), suggesting that patterns reveal structure and relationships. In fact, structure, pattern, and relations are mutually dependent aspects of mathematical thinking, any of which may be taken as primary. Poincaré, for example, begins with relations and arrives at structure:</p><p>Mathematicians do not study objects, but relations among objects; they are indifferent to the replacement of objects by others as long as the relations don't change. Matter is not important, only form interests them. (cited in <ref type="bibr">Gallian, 1994, p. 102)</ref> And I would argue that structure gives rise to relationships and patterns. Thus, when I speak of a structural view of mathematics, I mean a view that embodies all of these aspects.</p><p>Devlin's thesis raises a number of practical questions: What are the implications for the mathematics curriculum? Should all students experience mathematics as abstract patterns, structure, and relationships? If so, how might such ideas be taught? Just when do mathematics students, particularly future mathematicians and secondary teachers, have an opportunity to develop such a perspective about mathematics? And what do students take from such experiences? To what extent is the representational structure of natural language sufficient for reasoning about mathematics? Where does natural language fall short?</p><p>With the organization of today's mathematics curriculum, few students ever have an opportunity to develop a structural view of mathematics. Mathematics majors are first exposed to such a view of mathematics in a university course called abstract algebra, typically taken in their junior or senior year. The course usually focuses on elementary group theory and often also includes introductions to ring theory and other abstract structures. It is worth pointing out that examples from group theory form a significant portion of Devlin's description of what mathematics is.</p><p>The structural view of mathematics has been an organizing theme in the mathematics research community since the group of mathematicians known collectively as Bourbaki identified three mother structures: algebraic structure, order structure, topological structure, although they allow for the possibility of additional fundamental structures (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Bourbaki, 1950</ref>, for an overview). Beginning in 1939, this influential group published a collection of texts under the title Éléments de Mathématique, intended to set mathematics on a firm footing. In a short expository piece, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Bourbaki (1950)</ref> simultaneously present a description of the structural view and an argument for the formal, abstract, axiomatic method upon which it is based, acknowledging explicitly the difficulty of higher stages of abstraction and "the great problem of relations between the empirical world and the mathematical world" (p. 231). And, once again, group theory serves as the canonical example.</p><p>During the 1960s, curriculum developers and some psychologists adopted structure as a central theme, though not always with the same motivations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Piaget (1970a)</ref>, for example, was interested primarily in mental structures, and so structure was a fundamental characteristic of his psychogenetic theory. He was subsequently taken by the structures suggested by Bourbaki, such as the analogy between his concept of reversibility and the algebraic concept of inverse. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Ernest (1994)</ref> goes so far as to say, "Piaget was seduced by the Bourbakian account of mathematics as logically constituted by three mother structures" (p. 2). <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Bruner (1960</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Bruner ( /1977</ref>, on the other hand, took structure to be a fundamental characteristic of the disciplines and suggested that structure must be taught. "The task ... is one of representing the structure of that subject in terms of the child's way of viewing things" (p. 33). Judging from the movements in the mathematics curriculum since the "new math," it seems that the structure has largely faded in school mathematics, but structure has remained at least a dominant background influence in the upper-level undergraduate mathematics curriculum.</p><p>Despite this history, little is available in the mathematics education literature about how students learn content, such as group theory, that typifies the structural view. And less is known about the extent to which learning group theory helps students develop a structural view of mathematics. This study aimed to contribute to the empirical and theoretical work in this area of mathematics education by investigating student learning in abstract algebra, or more specifically, group theory. Like Devlin's book, this study was about mathematics, language, and representations, but rather than taking such a global and evolutionary view, it was more exploratory, beginning at the level of individual students in a college mathematics class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rationale</head><p>The reasons for investigating student learning in group theory are manifold. First, such investigations can contribute to an understanding of advanced mathematical thinking, especially because group theory typifies what modern mathematics is about, as discussed above. Second, students often find the course difficult, and instructors are often dissatisfied with the level of understanding reached by the students. Third, the research in this area is particularly thin. And fourth, because the course is typically required of preservice secondary teachers, there are potential implications for teacher education.</p><p>These reasons are elaborated below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Mathematical Thinking</head><p>Tall (1992) suggests that "advanced mathematical thinking … is characterized by two important components: precise mathematical definitions (including the statement of axioms in axiomatic theories) and logical deductions of theorems based upon them" (p. 495). Over the past decade and a half, the mathematics education community has seen growing interest in the study of advanced mathematical thinking and, simultaneously, in research in the teaching and learning of undergraduate mathematics.</p><p>Although there was some scholarly work in this area in the 1970s and early 1980s, a community of researchers was formally established with the creation in 1985 of the working group on advanced mathematical thinking within the International Group on the Psychology of Mathematics Education (PME). Since then, accompanying the broader curricular and pedagogical reforms in undergraduate mathematics <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Dossey, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Douglas, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr">National Research Council, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Steen, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b187">Tucker &amp; Leitzel, 1994)</ref>, scholarly interest in the teaching and learning of undergraduate mathematics has grown and intersected with the broader mathematics community, as evidenced by the increasing numbers of sessions at the Joint Mathematics Meetings devoted to educational issues and particularly by the creation in 1999 of the Association for Research in Undergraduate Mathematics Education (ARUME), which has since become a special interest group of the Mathematical Association of America.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature Is Thin</head><p>Despite these developments, the research literature in advanced mathematical thinking and undergraduate mathematics education has been and remains sparse, particularly regarding the learning of post-calculus mathematics. This is perhaps a particular symptom of a general phenomenon that the amount of research literature diminishes sharply as one proceeds from elementary school to secondary school to undergraduate mathematics. One comprehensive survey of the literature in undergraduate mathematics education was conducted in 1995 <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">(Scher &amp; Findell, 1996)</ref>, at about the time this study was conceived. Based on literature published in journals and known collections (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Kaput &amp; Dubinsky, 1994)</ref> between 1985 and 1994, the survey found 312 research articles on the teaching and learning of undergraduate mathematics and categorized them according to mathematical content and research outcome. Of those 312 articles, fewer than 30 could clearly be described as attending to the teaching and learning of content beyond first-year calculus, and only two concerned the learning of abstract algebra. The research about the teaching and learning of undergraduate mathematics has grown since 1994, particularly through the publication of volumes II through IV of Research in Collegiate Mathematics Education (Dubinsky, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Schoenfeld, &amp; Kaput, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kaput, Schoenfeld, &amp; Dubinsky, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schoenfeld, Kaput, &amp; Dubinsky, 1998)</ref>. And although there is substantial recent work in linear algebra <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Dorier, 2000)</ref>, the literature specific to the teaching and learning of abstract algebra remains thin. A literature search using the same criteria as the previous survey revealed 15 articles on the learning of abstract algebra. Eleven of them had bee published since 1994, of which 9 grew from the work of Dubinsky, Leron, and their collaborators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Difficulties with Teaching and Learning</head><p>Some research has indicated student understanding of the concepts in abstract algebra is less than satisfactory (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Dubinsky, Dautermann, Leron, &amp; Zazkis, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Hazzan &amp; Leron, 1996)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Leron and Dubinsky (1995)</ref> go so far as to declare that the teaching of abstract algebra is a disaster and to claim that there is wide consensus on this view among both instructors and students. This view may be indicative of a larger problem: The transition to advanced mathematics courses, particularly those beyond calculus, is often problematic. <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Harel (1989)</ref> proposes several reasons why the learning of linear algebra is difficult for students, which I paraphrase as an initial characterization of the difficulties with abstract algebra. First, the concepts are abstract structures that serve as categories for a broad and diverse range of examples. The objects are defined by their properties, and the properties rather than the examples are primary, making it hard for students to conceive of them.</p><p>Second, many of the examples themselves are unfamiliar to the students. And third, many students are not yet comfortable with proof and the axiomatic method. Regarding the last point, it is worth mentioning that linear algebra is often studied before abstract algebra. But in some mathematics programs, the approach to linear algebra is fairly concrete, unlike the abstract approach Harel describes. Furthermore, some mathematics programs require that students take a course in "mathematical proof," before they take abstract algebra. Even with such experiences, there is reason to believe that students</p><p>have not yet transcended the difficulties with proof (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Moore, 1994)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract Algebra for Future Teachers</head><p>There is widespread agreement on the need for improvements in teacher preparation and professional development in mathematics, as evidenced in the plethora of recent reports that discuss teacher education. The reports recommend ways to improve the system of teacher education <ref type="bibr">(Kilpatrick, Swafford, &amp; Findell, 2001</ref>; National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st <ref type="bibr">Century, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">National Research Council, 2001a</ref>), recommend mathematics that should be required of future teachers (Conference Board of the Mathematical <ref type="bibr">Sciences, 2001</ref>), and reframe questions about the content and delivery of mathematics teacher education <ref type="bibr">(National Research Council, 2001b</ref>), yet there has been little empirical or theoretical work exploring the relevance of particular mathematics courses in the preparation of future teachers. Most certification programs for prospective secondary mathematics teachers require a course in abstract algebra. Thus, by exploring what students do learn in an abstract algebra course, this study provides some empirical and theoretical backing for ways to implement and improve upon the recommendations.</p><p>For some time, professional organizations and committees have agreed that the study of abstract algebraic structures is an important part of a secondary preservice teacher's mathematical preparation (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Leitzel, 1991</ref>; National Council of Teachers of Mathematics [NCTM], 1991; Committee on the Undergraduate Program in <ref type="bibr">Mathematics, 1971)</ref>. Although these reports provide little in the way of rationale, the dominant point of view is that the equivalent of a major in mathematics should be required of prospective high school teachers <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Ferrini-Mundy &amp; Findell, 2001</ref>).</p><p>The implicit rationale might be that a major in mathematics is necessary in order to understand secondary school mathematics with sufficient depth. And, as elaborated below, powerful ideas from advanced mathematics can explain and unite ideas from school mathematics. A recent report on the mathematical education of teachers (Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences, 2001) acknowledges, however, that "unfortunately, too many prospective high school teachers fail to understand connections between [abstract algebra and number theory] and the topics of school algebra" (p. 40).</p><p>Group theory is "one of the oldest (and also one of the simplest) of axiomatic theories" <ref type="bibr">(Bourbaki, 1950, p. 224</ref>).</p><p>Consider, for example, the following four mathematical systems:</p><p>1. The integers {… , -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, …} under the operation of addition. This system is denoted Z.</p><p>2. The whole numbers less than a given whole number n, {0, 1, 2, … , n -1}, under the operation of addition, where addition is given by the remainder after dividing the usual sum by n. This system is denoted Z n .</p><p>3. The translations of the plane, where the operation is given by composition, that is, following one translation by another.</p><p>4. The set of 2 × 2 matrices of real numbers with determinant 1, under matrix multiplication.</p><p>Each of these examples consists of a set of elements (numbers or translations) together with an operation that specifies how to combine two of the elements to get an element that is also in the set. Because the operation combines two elements, it is often called a binary operation. In order to talk about these examples simultaneously, the operation is denoted by *, where the interpretations are addition, addition "modulo n," composition, and matrix multiplication, respectively, in the four examples.</p><p>With some work, it is possible to see that each of these systems satisfies the following axioms:</p><p>1. Associativity. For any three elements, x, y, and z, in the set (not necessarily distinct), (x*y)*z = x*(y*z).</p><p>2. Identity. There is an element, e, in the set, such that for any x in the set, e*x = x = x*e. (For addition of integers, the identity is 0; for addition modulo n, the identity is 0; for translations of the plane, it is the "identity" translation that leaves every point fixed; for matrices under multiplication, it is the "identity" matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere.)</p><p>3. Inverse. For each element x in the set, there is an element y in the set such that x*y = e = y*x.</p><p>A fourth (or zero th ) axiom, closure, is built into the requirements of a binary operation:</p><p>that the combination of two elements gives an element that still lies in the set. It should be pointed out that commutativity is not one of the axioms, and it is not hard to see that matrix multiplication is not commutative.</p><p>Any set and operation that together satisfy these axioms is said to be a group. When the operation is also commutative, the group is said to be Abelian. The advantage of the axiomatic approach is that any result (i.e., theorem) that can be proved on the basis of the axioms alone necessarily applies to all four examples and also to any other mathematical system that satisfies the axioms.</p><p>The important results in group theory depend upon a collection of related concepts. A subgroup, for example, is a subset of a group, which is itself a group under the group's operation. The role of structure again returns to the fore with the concept of isomorphism. On a high level, the group axioms define an algebraic structure that applies to a broad collection of mathematical systems. The axioms create the rudimentary structure to which all groups must conform. At a lower level, every specific group is a mathematical system with its own internal structure. An important abstraction can occur when two groups appear in different settings and yet are "essentially the same." The intuitive idea is that two groups are structurally the same, or isomorphic, if they differ only in the names of their elements and operation. Demonstrating that two groups are isomorphic requires finding a renaming that preserves the group operation. Such a renaming, which is essentially a function that takes elements from one group to the other, is called an isomorphism.</p><p>It should be pointed out that the above mathematical systems and other standard examples may not be familiar to undergraduates in a first course in abstract algebra. Thus, some of the student's energy must be spent trying to build some familiarity with the examples.</p><p>Taken together, these examples and the concepts of group, subgroup, and isomorphism constitute the fundamental concepts of group theory for the purpose of this study.</p><p>I distinguish as "advanced concepts of group theory" those concepts that require the construction of new objects. Given a subgroup H, one can create a left coset of the subgroup by multiplying an element a of the group on the left by each of the elements in the subgroup. The coset is denoted aH. When the set of left cosets forms a group by extending the group operation to the cosets, the resulting group is called a quotient group, and the subgroup that gave rise to the cosets is said to be normal.</p><p>Other important mathematical structures are rings and fields. In ring theory, there are two operations, typically called multiplication and addition. Examples are the arithmetic of integers, of matrices, and of polynomials in one variable with integer coefficients. A field is essentially a ring in which multiplication is commutative and division is also possible, except, of course, division by zero. Examples are the rational numbers, the complex numbers, and the integers modulo p, where p is prime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Big Ideas of Abstract Algebra</head><p>A course in abstract algebra is the place where students might extract common features from the many mathematical systems that they have used in previous mathematics courses, such as calculus, linear algebra, and school algebra. Students have opportunities to develop deeper understandings of concepts such as identity, inverse, equivalence, and function. What is shared, for example, by the identity for multiplication of real numbers, the identity matrix, and the identity function? What is the common idea behind the inverse of a function, the inverse of a matrix, and the multiplicative inverse of a number?</p><p>In abstract algebra, students can also learn about the importance of precise language in mathematics and about the role of definitions in supporting such precision. Mathematics is also about noticing when things are the same and being able to describe how they are different. In abstract algebra, this naïve notion of "sameness" becomes formalized in the concept of isomorphism.</p><p>Thus, it is clear that the concepts in abstract algebra provide guiding themes, principles, and sensibilities that pervade mathematics. It is not so clear, however, what sequence of topics from abstract algebra can be constructed to help students recognize and appreciate such themes. And, in particular, it is not clear whether an abstract algebra course intended for mathematics majors, as it is typically taught, can serve such a role.</p><p>When the population of students in an abstract algebra course includes future teachers (which may be almost always), these big ideas, such as inverse and identity, are particularly important because they can help teachers connect advanced mathematics with high school mathematics in ways that can strengthen and deepen their understandings of the mathematics they will teach. Of course, it is also crucial that future teachers are able to employ those new understandings in their teaching, but that concern takes us beyond the scope of this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptualizing the Study</head><p>In the previous sections, I provide a rationale for an investigation of student learning in abstract algebra and a short description of what abstract algebra is. The remainder of this chapter describes how I arrived at this particular study and presents the research questions.</p><p>My interest in the teaching and learning of abstract algebra stems from my own experiences as a student and as an instructor. I found the subject quite difficult myself, both as an undergraduate and as a graduate student in mathematics. When I first taught abstract algebra to undergraduate mathematics majors at a state college, my hope was to provide more conceptual and concrete support for the students than I had been given.</p><p>Upon beginning my graduate program in mathematics education, I imagined several possible thesis topics, but foremost among these was learning in abstract algebra. In particular, I was interested in exploring students' conceptual understandings.</p><p>Some of the literature on the learning of advanced undergraduate mathematics focuses on students' difficulties writing proofs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Moore, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Hart, 1994)</ref>. While this literature confirms that structuring, organizing, and writing proofs presents significant difficulties for many undergraduates, there are also significant obstacles in the concepts themselves .</p><p>As I began to conceptualize this study, I had an opportunity, as part of a graduate course in mathematics education, to interview an undergraduate abstract algebra student on several abstract algebra tasks. That experience and subsequent pilot activity not only served to develop my interviewing skills but also confirmed that students' conceptual understandings in abstract algebra was a researchable area in the sense that the subtleties in students' thinking seemed interesting and worth exploring.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Questions</head><p>In investigating students' understandings of advanced mathematics, my intent was to begin building a theory: a representation of student's understandings, or, alternatively, an understanding of students' representations. The central theoretical construct for this study was the notion of a concept image <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">(Tall &amp; Vinner, 1981)</ref>, which denotes the entire cognitive structure associated with a concept, including examples, representations, processes, and the relationships among them. The concept image is distinguished from a concept definition, which is a form of words used to specify a concept, and which I take to be part of the concept image. It is helpful to imagine a concept image as a network in which the links indicate relationships between ideas. The metaphor of a conceptual network accommodates the perspective that new knowledge builds on prior understandings, and so I investigated not only students' understandings in group theory but also how preliminary mathematical understandings were involved in students'</p><p>learning.</p><p>My interest in characterizing students' understandings led ultimately to the following research questions:</p><p>• What are the prominent characteristics and components of students' concept images as they are learning the fundamental ideas of group, subgroup, and isomorphism?</p><p>• What are the prominent characteristics and components of students' concept images as they are learning the more advanced ideas of homomorphism, coset, and quotient group?</p><p>• How do students' understandings of prior mathematics come into play as they are learning elementary group theory?</p><p>The context for the study was a nontraditional class in which the instruction was based largely on problem sets that the students completed in collaborative groups of three or four students. In such a setting, and without a comparison group, it was not possible to determine the causes of many of the events. The goal of this study was not comparison, however, but rather to begin building a theory supported by a thick description of the issues that students grappled with around the mathematical content of elementary group theory while they were in the process of learning.</p><p>The following chapter reviews the relevant literature on the teaching and learning of abstract algebra. Chapter 3 sets forth the conceptual and analytical framework that guided this study. Chapter 4 describes the context and methodology. Chapters 5 through 7 address the research questions in turn. And chapter 8 provides conclusions and implications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CHAPTER II</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LITERATURE REVIEW</head><p>To synthesize the research on the teaching and learning of abstract algebra, it is useful to consider first two categories: those articles connected with Dubinsky's framework for research and curriculum development ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Asiala et al., 1996)</ref> and those that are not. These sections are followed by a brief discussion of research on the learning of proof. To complement the educational research, I include discussion of historical literature describing the genesis and evolution of algebra and also some of the literature that provides suggestions for curriculum or instruction. Much of this literature takes a negative tone, describing difficulties, errors, obstacles, and the ways in which student understanding falls short of expert understanding. Clearly, the field could benefit from an approach that begins organically, with students' ways of thinking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dubinsky's Framework</head><p>The work of Dubinsky and his colleagues is based on a well-articulated framework for research and curriculum development in undergraduate mathematics education <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Asiala et al., 1996)</ref>, which grows largely from Dubinsky's (1991) elaboration of Piaget's notion of reflective abstraction. The core of framework is the theoretical perspective that all mathematical conceptions can be understood as actions, processes, objects, or schemas (hence the acronym APOS). The categories may be seen as an extension of the process/object distinction that is well developed in the literature and that is discussed in detail in chapter 3. It is important to keep in mind that the theoretical perspective provides ways to categorize students' thinking about mathematical concepts, not categories for the concepts themselves. Thus, one student may have an action conception of coset and another a process conception. The categories are roughly developmental, with each new conception requiring new mental constructions.</p><p>According to Dubinsky's theory, an action conception is different from a process conception in that in the former, the student is particularly focused on going through specific procedural steps and is unable to talk clearly about one of the steps until all the previous steps have been carried out. An action conception can become a process conception through a mental construction called interiorization. Then, the student can think about the result of the process without actually having done it and, in particular, can imagine reversing the process. A student who has an object conception of a mathematical idea can imagine it as a totality and, in particular, can act on it with higher- level actions or processes. Processes can be encapsulated into objects, and it is sometimes useful that the student be able to de-encapsulate an object to focus on the underlying process. Schemas are coordinated collections of actions, processes, objects, and other schemas, which can themselves be encapsulated into objects.</p><p>Dubinsky's research and development framework consists of three activities: theoretical analysis, design and implementation of instruction, and observation and evaluation of the implemented instruction. The theoretical analysis describes the actions, processes, objects, and schemas that students might construct in order to develop an understanding of the target concepts. Instructional activities are designed specifically to help students make the constructions identified in the theoretical analysis and typically include computer activities using the programming language ISETL (Interactive Set Language), whose syntax closely resembles mathematical notation. Evaluation consists largely of interviews and written exams to determine to what extent students made the desired constructions. The framework is cyclical in that observation and evaluation inform revisions in the theoretical perspective, which informs subsequent instructional design, and so on. The research papers primarily report the results of a particular implementation, focusing primarily on characterizing the action, process, and object conceptions of students, reporting the numbers of students in each category, and, sometimes, comparing results with classes that had received traditional instruction.</p><p>On the learning of abstract algebra, the evaluation of the first round of curriculum development is reported in a research article  and the resulting second version of the curriculum has been published .</p><p>Dubinsky et al. conclude, not surprisingly, that many of the concepts, especially coset and quotient group, seem quite difficult for students, and they offer some explanations.</p><p>They discuss a number of cognitive obstacles that are common among beginning abstract algebra students. Regarding the group concept, the idea of an abstract binary operation poses a significant obstacle for students, who often think of a group as a set and ignore the operation. Students are often unable to correctly answer questions about cosets in and quotients of noncyclic groups, and they often confuse normality with commutativity.</p><p>Although some of the students can perform the calculations required for listing the elements in a coset, they have difficulty thinking of cosets as objects that can themselves be manipulated. It may seem obvious that a set is an object, but sets are often described by a process that lists all elements or that would eventually list any element. In this way a set is a process. A set is not a full-fledged object in the mind of the student until the student can imagine a set as an element of another set. The researchers isolate certain prerequisites for success in abstract algebra, including understanding of functions as both processes and objects.</p><p>This research has been criticized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Burn (1996)</ref>, who characterizes  as a report of a novel teaching procedure using the computer and particular activities. He suggests that the fundamental concepts of group theory may be not group, subgroup, coset, and normality, but rather closure, associativity, identity, inverse, function, and set. Burn further points out that some of the interview excerpts that were regarded as misconceptions may actually reveal insight on the part of the student (e.g.,</p><p>closure is enough to determine whether a subset of a finite group is a subgroup).</p><p>Furthermore, quotient groups are quite easy to see in some situations (e.g., even and odd integers, rotation and reflection in the transformations of the plane). It should not be surprising, Burn suggests, that the concepts in abstract algebra can be described in the language of sets and functions, but that may be twentieth century analysis imposed on nineteenth century ideas. (I would point out that in order to implement the concepts in ISETL, it is necessary to view them as sets and functions.) Finally, he proposes that automorphisms (specifically permutations and symmetries) may be more profitably viewed as the fundamental concepts of group theory. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Dubinsky et al. (1997)</ref> respond by reaffirming that their previous article is not a report of a novel teaching procedure but an attempt to contribute to knowledge of how students understand certain concepts in group theory. Regarding Burns' unsupported claims about the ease with which students might understand certain instances of quotient group or permutation, they suggest that Burns conduct a study and report on it.</p><p>The second iteration of research and curriculum development using the APOS framework to study the learning of abstract algebra is reported in a collection of articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Asiala, Brown, Kleiman, &amp; Mathews, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Asiala, Dubinsky, Mathews, Morics, &amp; Oktac, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Brown, DeVries, Dubinsky, &amp; Thomas, 1997</ref>; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Clark et al., 1997</ref>, for an overview). The general conclusion of these articles is that the authors' initial epistemological analyses of the various topics are supported by the data, in the sense that the analyses describe the important processes, objects, and schemas that students need to construct in order to learn the those topics. The authors then typically offer refinements of the epistemological analyses and later offer pedagogical suggestions. Some specific conclusions include the suggestion that the crucial idea in calculating a quotient group may be constructing the binary operation, the importance of being able to choose appropriately between two binary operations defined on a set (e.g., multiplication and addition), and specific misconceptions such as the fact that some students believe Z n is a subgroup of Z.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Thinking</head><p>Although the literature on the learning of abstract algebra contains a small number of research articles, the list of misconceptions identified is not short. <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Selden and Selden (1978)</ref> alone list thirteen types of errors, many of which might occur in any undergraduate mathematics course. Some commonly found misconceptions include confusion about the group operation, particularly when the problem involves more than one group <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Hart, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Selden &amp; Selden, 1978)</ref>, believing that the only solution to the equation x = x -1 was the identity element <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Hazzan, 1994)</ref>, using techniques from the real numbers in the abstract setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(Selden &amp; Selden, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Hazzan, 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Hazzan, , 1999</ref>), confusing a theorem and its converse <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(Selden &amp; Selden, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Hazzan, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Hazzan &amp; Leron, 1996)</ref>, and difficulty managing the distinction between set and element <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Hazzan, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Selden &amp; Selden, 1978)</ref>. This last distinction is further complicated by the fact that the elements of the quotient group are themselves sets.</p><p>Some of the above misconceptions are tied to the use of mathematical notation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Selden and Selden (1978)</ref> found, for example, that students often use the same symbol for two different things, and, conversely, they often assume things are distinct because they have different names. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Hazzan (1994)</ref> suggests, regarding the use of different letters in the axiom for inverses, that it is easier to think of a relation between two different objects than of an object with itself.</p><p>Other difficulties seem to be tied to other sorts of representations. As part of a study on visual and analytic thinking,  investigated abstract algebra students' ability to represent the elements of D 4 , the group of symmetries of the square and then to find the product of two elements. This task can be approached either "visually," using a geometric representation, or "analytically," using permutation representations. They found that most students used a combination of these approaches, suggesting that the dichotomy between visual and analytic thinkers may be false. They propose an alternative model that assumes visual and analytic thinking to be mutually dependent in mathematical problem solving.</p><p>The study also produced some unexpected mathematical results ). Eight of ten students found as they translated between the geometric and permutation representations that the groups were not isomorphic, causing Zazkis and Dubinsky to conclude that the dihedral groups such as D 4 are not groups until some structure is imposed on them in the sense that the relationship between the group operations in the two representations must be specified appropriately. By careful analysis of the ways to translate from the geometric to the permutation representation, they found that students could focus on the square and where its vertices traveled (an object interpretation) or on the four positions and which vertices they contained after the transformation (a position interpretation). In computing the product of two transformation symmetries in the geometric representation, students could imagine either that the axes describing the transformations were fixed (a global interpretation) or that they traveled with the square (a local interpretation). Choosing either the object/global or the position/local pair of interpretations results in the desired isomorphism between the geometric and permutation representations. Most students, however, were drawn to the position/global pair or the object/local pair, which caused the groups to be anti- isomorphic, in the sense that the order of multiplication is reversed. Zazkis and Dubinsky suggest that the embedding of dihedral groups in permutation groups deserves some careful attention in instruction.</p><p>Hannah (2000) pursued Zazkis and Dubinsky's ideas through a teaching experiment.</p><p>Expecting that students would prefer the global interpretation, he encouraged the object interpretation by using additional labels to separate the object from the position. About half the students still preferred the position interpretation, although one of these students also chose the local interpretation, thus leading to an isomorphism between the geometric and permutation representations. In the second trial of the teaching experiment, after making some additional adjustments in his notation to make the object and frame of reference more salient, all but one student chose consistent interpretations. Hannah also found that permutation notation can lead to the same local/global interpretational issues. <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Leron, Hazzan, and Zazkis (1995)</ref> discuss the development of the concept of group isomorphism. Some of the difficulties, they suggest, may actually be with quantification.</p><p>They note that the naïve concept of isomorphism (same group with the names changed) is a good start, but the object isomorphism is defined directionally, with the two groups playing different roles, and requires a sophisticated concept of function. In other words, although there is symmetry in the statement that two groups are isomorphic, actually finding an isomorphism requires choosing one group as the source (the domain of a function) and the other as the target. When trying to construct an isomorphism between two groups, they note that students hope for a canonical (or at least obvious) isomorphism and get stuck when there is a choice.</p><p>Hazzan and <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Leron (1996)</ref> argue that the standard formulation of Lagrange's theorem hides its nature and its deep meaning. The standard formulation is:</p><p>Let G be a finite group. If H is a subgroup of G, then o(H) divides o(G).</p><p>The notation o(G) signifies the order of the group, 1 that is, the number of elements in it.</p><p>The authors suggest that the contrapositive of the theorem includes explicit quantifiers that make its nature as a nonexistence theorem clearer and reveal its deep meaning:</p><p>Contrapositive: If k does not divide o(G), then there does not exist a subgroup of order k.</p><p>Deep meaning: If there exists a subgroup of order k, then k divides o(G).</p><p>This analysis of Lagrange's theorem arose in response to data collected on the question, "Is Z 3 a subgroup of Z 6 ?" Out of 113 students, 73 gave incorrect answers. Of these, 20</p><p>gave some version of, "Yes, by Lagrange's theorem, because 3 divides 6." Hazzan and</p><p>Leron suggest that students' response may be due to a coping mechanism and may not really reflect thinking about the theorem and the two groups. The authors explore issues of coping more fully elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Leron &amp; Hazzan, 1997</ref>).</p><p>In a broader study of learning in abstract algebra, <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Hazzan (1999)</ref> found that students tended to reduce the abstraction level in order to cope with the task at hand. She organized her results according to three ways of looking at the level of abstraction.</p><p>Regarding abstraction level as the quality of the relationships between the object of thought and the thinking person, she found that students tend to make the unfamiliar familiar by basing their argument, for example, on numbers and number operations.</p><p>Regarding abstraction level as a reflection of the process/object duality, she found that students tend to personalize formal expressions and logical arguments by using first- person language and that they tend to engage a well-rehearsed procedure rather than rely on theoretical knowledge. Regarding abstraction level as the degree of complexity of the concept of thought, she found that students sometimes reduce abstraction level by replacing a set with one of its elements.</p><p>Hirsh <ref type="bibr">(1981)</ref> describes an abstract algebra course for preservice secondary school teachers that included a "didactical shadow" seminar in which the mathematical concepts were followed closely by readings and discussions on teaching K-12 mathematics. These readings were intended to encourage preservice teachers to see abstract algebra as relevant in their future as secondary school teachers. The study found significant improvement in the experimental group in the students' understanding of the real number system and nonsignificant improvement in the control group. On several affective measures, no significant differences between groups were found. The most important result, Hirsch suggests, was that the study demonstrated the feasibility of such a course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof</head><p>As stated in chapter 1, mathematical proof is one of the defining characteristics of advanced mathematical thinking, and proof plays a central role in the learning of abstract algebra. Because the role of proof did not play a central role in this study, this section briefly reviews literature that was helpful in framing the study.</p><p>One of the leading expositors of the role of proof in mathematics education is Gila Hanna <ref type="bibr">(1991,</ref><ref type="bibr">1995)</ref>. She suggests that constructivist theories have led to a mistaken view of the teacher as playing a passive role and of proof as being unimportant. She argues for recognizing and promoting proof in the mathematics curriculum as a key tool for promoting understanding. The research on the role of proof in mathematics education is thin and confused by the typical four-year separation between proof in high school geometry and proof in undergraduate mathematics.</p><p>Hart <ref type="bibr">(1986,</ref><ref type="bibr">1994</ref>) describes a research study in which twenty-nine college mathematics majors, taking different abstract algebra courses from beginning undergraduate to beginning graduate, were asked to write six standard abstract algebra proofs, each "doable in 15 minutes or less." On the basis of their performance on three criterion proofs, students were classified into four levels of conceptual understanding. Analysis of errors made, processes used, correctness of proofs, and student assessment of tasks suggested that the journey from novice to expert in a content domain may be an irregular and unstable developmental process, rather than the dichotomy often assumed in the literature.</p><p>In a mathematics course called Introduction to Higher Mathematics, Moore <ref type="bibr">(1990,</ref><ref type="bibr">1994)</ref> found seven major sources of student difficulties in learning to do proofs, including inability to state the definitions, inadequate concept images, inability to use the definition to structure a proof, inability or unwillingness to generate examples, and difficulty with mathematical language and notation. He suggests that the concept image/concept definition dichotomy was not sufficient to explain his results and suggested the term concept usage to discuss how students used definitions to generate and use examples, applied definitions within proofs, and used definitions to structure proofs. Although in Moore's work this construct more accurately describes students' use of concept definitions rather than of concepts, thinking about concept usage proved helpful in this study in identifying components and characteristics of students' concept images, as described below.</p><p>Taken together, these articles support the idea of investigating not only students'</p><p>understandings of concepts but also their personal definitions of those concepts. Proof, after all, involves reasoning about concepts, which must be meaningful to the students in order to support such reasoning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Sfard (1995)</ref> gives a detailed a description of the historical development of algebra with strong connections to the teaching and learning of both school and abstract algebra, providing compelling support for the claim that historical-critical and psychogenetic studies should converge <ref type="bibr">(Piaget &amp; Garcia, 1989, p. 108)</ref>. According to Sfard, group theory arose out of the work of Lagrange and Ruffini, who noticed that methods of solving polynomial equations depended on permutations of the roots. Soon permutations and then, with Cauchy, operations on those permutations became objects of attention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>History</head><p>Galois defined the notion of a group by declaring interest in the structure imposed on the permutations by the so-called substitutions. Cayley freed the concept from any commitment as to the nature of the elements, focusing instead on the manipulations.</p><p>With the invention of the concept of group, the seeds had been planted for algebra to become a science of abstract structures.</p><p>Kleiner (1986) describes four lines of inquiry that coalesced toward the end of the nineteenth century to form the area we now call abstract algebra.

Third, attempts to unify and organize geometry led to transformation groups. Finally, roots in analysis led to investigation of continuous transformation groups. One response to this account is to use historically important problems to provide pedagogical and intellectual motivation in the teaching of abstract algebra (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Kleiner, 1995</ref>).</p><p>Nicholson's (1993) account of the slow historical development of the concept of quotient group can provide additional sources for cognitive roots to be exploited. She suggests several obstacles that were overcome by the mathematics community during the development of this concept. First, the community needed an abstract concept of group that was not dependent on any particular representation. Second, the community needed the concept of equivalence (modulo a subgroup). Finally (and most importantly), the community needed to realize that the elements of the quotient group are not like the elements of original group, but are equivalence classes-sets. All of these historical developments provide clues about what might be the issues for students learning the subject. In this study, I paid attention in particular to the ways in which students develop an abstract concept of group and the sense in which they consider sets to be elements of quotient group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Teaching Suggestions</head><p>I close the review of the literature with a discussion of articles that informed the development of the course, that provide additional rationale for investigating learning in abstract algebra, and that collectively support the decision to investigate learning in a nontraditional course.</p><p>In "An Abstract Algebra Story," <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Leron and Dubinsky (1995)</ref> condense the principles and research behind their textbook ) into a dialogue with an "idealized reader." They begin by asserting that "The teaching of abstract algebra is a disaster, and this remains true almost independently of the quality of the lectures"</p><p>(p. 227). They suggest that the ISETL computer activities provide an experiential basis for the abstractions that follow, asserting that "if the students are asked to construct the group concept on the computer (by programming it), there is a good chance that a parallel construction will occur in their mind" (p. 230).</p><p>In Dubinsky and Leron's approach, before seeing the concept of quotient group, the students have already explored a construct they call GmodH, which is the set of cosets in G of a subgroup H, independent of whether H is normal, an approach consistent with that recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Benson and Richey (1994)</ref>. Leron and Dubinsky acknowledge that the notation GmodH is unorthodox, particularly when H is not normal, but defend their approach by noting that students realize they need to look into the properties of H that make GmodH a group and come to appreciate that the main issue is closure.</p><p>Furthermore,</p><p>by building on the material that the students bring up, the instructor is able to state most naturally and smoothly the definition of a normal subgroup, the theorem that when H is normal then GmodH forms a group, and the (now very easy) proof of this theorem. Normality is naturally introduced here as the condition which insures that GmodH be a group, and the definition most often discovered by students is aH = Ha for all a ∈ G. Except for the new name, the students can really feel that the instructor merely summarizes what they have found in their investigations. In the session that follows, the instructor makes the final ties with the "standard" approach by explaining that when H is normal, GmodH is commonly denoted G/H, and is called the quotient group of G modulo H and coset product is commonly defined by the formula (Ha)(Hb) = H(ab).</p><p>(p. 238) <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Freedman (1983)</ref> also rejects the lecture method, quoting Halmos, "A good lecture is usually systematic, complete, precise-and dull; it is a bad teaching instrument" (p. 631) and Moise, "It is simplistic to suppose that people remember what they are told and understand the things that are explained to them clearly" (p. 631). He discusses an approach he used in London in which students in a small seminar were each required to read and lecture on some original papers in abstract algebra. Although this approach may seem quite radical to instructors in the United States, he claims that the students worked together and were quite successful.</p><p>In response to the difficulties students usually have with Lagrange's theorem, Johnson <ref type="bibr">(1983)</ref> notes that the traditional proof involves cosets and equivalence relations, both of which are new concepts to most students. As Lagrange's theorem is usually used to prove the more intuitive theorem that the order of an element divides the order of the group, Johnson suggests proving the latter result first, for it follows quite naturally from the decomposition of a permutation into disjoint cycles. Of course, this approach assumes the students are familiar with permutation groups, and such an assumption might be unwarranted. <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Holton and Wenzel (1993)</ref> describe an abstract algebra course in which Lagrange's theorem is preceded by cooperative learning via examples. Rejecting the traditional approach of "exposition, exhortation and regurgitation" (p. 883), they found that students were able to conjecture the theorem and many of the necessary lemmas. Although it was not a formal research study, the description of the classroom environment was compelling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This review has shown that although there have been few published research studies on the learning of abstract algebra, there is a theoretical and empirical base on which to build. To complement the work embedded in the APOS framework, this study is more exploratory in nature, taking a broader view of the ways of thinking that students exhibit while trying to make sense of the concepts in the course. The next chapter describes the conceptual and analytical framework designed to support such an approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CHAPTER III</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCEPTUAL AND ANALYTICAL PERSPECTIVE</head><p>This chapter sets forth the conceptual perspective that guided this study and that contributed to the design of the analytical framework. Fundamentally, learning is seen as a process of making sense of experience and of building understanding, a viewpoint that is consistent with various forms of constructivism. The central theoretical construct is the notion of a concept image <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">(Tall &amp; Vinner, 1981)</ref>. The concept image is contrasted with the concept's definition, which leads to a discussion of the role of definitions in mathematics, in thinking, and in learning. The chapter continues with a discussion of other important constructs that are useful in describing the growth and character of concept images, particularly in advanced mathematical thinking, including abstraction and generalization and the distinction between process and object conceptions of mathematical ideas. The chapter also includes a discussion of the role of metaphor in mathematical thinking, with particular attention to thinking in abstract algebra. Next, I</p><p>discuss issues of naming and notation, setting the stage for a discussion of semiotics, which provides much of the analytical and theoretical backing for the study. These various theoretical constructs are then brought together at the end of the chapter in an analytical framework that undergirded the analysis of the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning with Understanding</head><p>This study was based upon the following fundamental theoretical assumptions that are consistent with a large body of work in cognitive science, psychology, and mathematics education (see, in particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Bransford, Brown, &amp; Cocking, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Hiebert &amp; Carpenter, 1992</ref>). First, human beings are conceptualizers in that they try to make sense of their percepts by developing concepts. People try to understand their experiences by organizing them, abstracting from them, creating categories, making connections, particularly with prior knowledge, and making distinctions. In high school and college mathematics, for example, students create a category called "function" by abstracting the common features of the many mathematical creatures called "function" in their experience. These abstracted features are not necessarily the properties that are isolated in the formal mathematical definition, as is elaborated below.</p><p>Second, knowledge is represented internally in the mind. People create internal representations for objects, processes, properties, and relationships; for images, sounds, smells, sensations, and impressions; and also for categories and networks of these. These mental representations do not match an external world but rather fit one's experience with some degree of viability <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">(von Glasersfeld, 1990)</ref>. Because mental representations are not observable, discussions of how ideas are represented in someone's head must be based largely on inference. Such inferences can be facilitated by building and testing models of individual understanding, as is elaborated below. A fundamental goal of research in the psychology of learning is to understand mental representations of ideas, by building models, describing their features, and so on, based on observation of learning situations. It is not necessary that the models match the underlying neural processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Kosslyn &amp; Hatfield, 1984)</ref>. Rather, the goal is that models fit the observations with some degree of viability, particularly with regard to explanation and prediction. In order to build such models, it is reasonable to assume that the external entity being represented influences and constrains the internal representation. In mathematics, these external entities are often themselves representations, such as symbols or diagrams, because mathematical ideas are accessible only through their representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Duvall, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">see also Pimm, 1995, p. 119</ref>).</p><p>Third, internal representations can be connected to one another in useful and hence meaningful ways. Successful learning may be described as learning with understanding, where understanding is characterized by connectivity. While in the process of learning, connections are made internally in the mind of the learner and over time the concepts, processes, properties, examples, and the connections among them grow to form cognitive structures that might be described as networks. In general, the more connections, the more intricate and encompassing are the networks, and the deeper are the understandings.</p><p>In this study, individual conceptual understandings are described via the term concept image, which denotes the entire cognitive structure that a particular individual associates with a particular concept, as elaborated below. In considering the notion of a concept image, it is important to contemplate not only a concept's structure and connections to other concepts but also the boundaries that distinguish the concept from related ideas.</p><p>Concept images and other cognitive structures are actively built up over time through experience and through active reflection on that experience. The structures, of course, depend heavily upon prior experience and also upon the nature and extent of the reflection. Thus, in response to an experience, the actual constructions are personal and idiosyncratic, which implies that learning and knowing, too, are personal. It is for these reasons that phrases such as "construct personal meaning" or "construct knowledge" are helpful in describing the learning process. This is not to say that all conceptual structures are equal. Some conceptual structures are particularly weak or fragile or lack long-term viability in light of future learning goals. Other structures are strong and persistent.</p><p>Some conceptual structures are unproductive and fade as a result. Other structures are productive and will support and promote future learning. And, of course, when measured against established knowledge, sometimes conceptual structures contain ideas that are incorrect.</p><p>The real quandary lies with strong, productive, but faulty structures with incorrect ideas-often called misconceptions. Independent of whether these are called knowledge, such structures are personal conceptions that are held with conviction and are based upon some reasoning, however incomplete or fallacious.</p><p>Piaget describes two mechanisms by which a subject makes sense of experience:</p><p>assimilation and accommodation (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">Steffe &amp; Wiegel, 1996</ref> The point is that new information is not simply received but is actively interpreted and filtered through prior experience. The experience must either make sense within the existing structure, in which case it is assimilated, or it must be "moderately novel" so that the experience creates a disequilibration, which can lead to an accommodation. The experience must be only moderately novel, for it must be sufficiently interpretable to create some cognitive conflict.</p><p>This balance between assimilation and accommodation makes the point that learning is sometimes difficult, and thus faultless communication is fiction. Papert suggests that, "Anything is easy if you can assimilate it to your collection of models. If you can't, anything can be painfully difficult…. What an individual can learn and how he learns it depends on what models he has available" (cited in Steffe, 1990, p. 173).</p><p>Given the above positions about the nature of learning, what then are the implications for the teaching of mathematics? First, mathematics itself is a highly structured and organized domain. For mathematical knowledge to be useable (or perhaps even accessible), it must be organized in some way in the mind. It is clearly not possible to transmit whole structures from the mind of the instructor to the mind of the student.</p><p>Rather, the student must do some constructing in his or her own mind. Second, it is impossible to know in advance what a person will learn from a given activity. Moreover, it is impossible to know with certainty what a person has learned, although an instructor or researcher can develop approximate models by asking questions. Explicit reflection, with the corrective mechanisms of the observations and responses of the teacher and other students, is likely to lead to strong, viable, and productive connections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship with Constructivism</head><p>Many of the above positions are consistent with the assumptions of any of several forms of constructivism.</p><p>What the various forms of constructivism all share is the metaphor of carpentry, architecture, of construction work. This is about the building up of structures from preexisting pieces, possibly specially shaped for the task. The metaphor describes understanding as the building of mental structures, and the term restructuring, often used as a synonym for accommodation or conceptual change, contains this metaphor. <ref type="bibr">(Ernest, 1996, p. 335)</ref> A key expositor of constructivism in mathematics education is Ernst von Glasersfeld, who proposes two principles for radical constructivism:</p><p>(a) Knowledge is not passively received but actively built up by the cognizing subject;</p><p>(b) the function of cognition is adaptive and serves the organization of the experiential world, not the discovery of ontological reality. <ref type="bibr">(von Glasersfeld, 1989, p. 162)</ref> Adopting only the first of these principles is to take a position that is sometimes called "weak constructivism" <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Ernest, 1996)</ref> or "trivial constructivism" <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">(von Glasersfeld, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>As <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Kilpatrick (1987)</ref> and others have noted, the first of these principles is broadly accepted and "almost no mathematics educator alive and writing today claims to believe otherwise" (p. 7). The second principle, on the other hand, is much more controversial.</p><p>My position is that whether one believes in an objective reality or Platonic ideals or denies both is, in a sense, immaterial because the student's cognitive structures will match neither reality, nor an ideal, nor the teacher's or researcher's cognitive structures but instead will fit each of these with varying degrees of viability. This is a particularly important point regarding the learning of mathematics, since mathematical concepts exist not in the physical world but rather in abstractions from activity in the physical world and in the mind.</p><p>In order to understand what constructivism provides, it is important to recognize that the theories arose in part as a response to what was missing from behaviorism, which refused to posit any meaning behind student's actions. Stimulus-response mechanisms were supposed to explain all behavior. Thus, constructivism was one of many efforts during the twentieth century to insert meaning and understanding into theories of knowledge and learning. But not all behavior is meaningful.</p><p>Vinner (1997) describes some behaviors as pseudo-conceptual and pseudo-analytical because they may be taken as an indication that true (i.e., meaningful) conceptual and analytical processes have occurred when in fact the behavior is little more than simple association and imitation based on superficial similarity. For example, a calculus student who immediately responds "2x" when hearing "x 2 " is not responding meaningfully if the response is merely a verbalized association. In a calculus class, sometimes this simple association will yield the correct answer, and it is impossible to know, without asking further questions, to what extent the student can construct (or resurrect) some meaning for the response. Students are bound to have such associations. Vinner's point is that in mathematics class, students should evaluate their associations consciously and critically, rather than merely verbalizing them in hopes of getting "credit." He argues that such verbalized associations should not be interpreted as indicating misconceptions or anything about a student's cognitive structures, because cognitive structures are not involved.</p><p>Part of the reason many students exhibit pseudo-conceptual behavior in mathematics is that they have found such behaviors to be viable in mathematics classes. Many students are successful in mathematics by relying almost exclusively on simple association and imitation, practicing problems that are just like the ones demonstrated in the textbook or by the teacher. Yet the severe filtering effect of high school and college mathematics suggests that for most students, mere imitation fails at some point, in arithmetic, algebra, geometry, or calculus.</p><p>Thus, learning with understanding requires the development of cognitive structures in which the connections are not simple associations but relationships that are rich in meaning. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Mathematical learning is rarely effective without such meaning, in the sense that it is unlikely to be durable, flexible, and supportive of future learning. Mathematical learning that is based only on simple associations is not mathematics at all, not to mention that such skills are fragile and essentially useless today.</p><p>There are certain meta-cognitive behaviors that may support learning even if they are simple associations. For example, my students learn that in response to their statements I am likely to say, "Okay. Why?" Some of them internalize this behavior and begin to ask the question themselves. Deborah Ball's class learned that she was likely to ask, "Are these all the solutions?" <ref type="bibr">(Ball &amp; Bass, in press;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b180">Suzuka, 2001)</ref>. And many of <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Polya's (1957)</ref> suggestions (Can I think of a similar problem? Can I simplify the problem?) can be seen in a similar light. The list of desirable behaviors also includes many so-called habits of mind that describe successful mathematics knowing and learning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Cuoco, Goldenberg, and Mark (1996)</ref> provide a compelling list of such habits, suggesting, for example, that students should learn to look for patterns, to watch for things that change, and also to watch for things that do not change.</p><p>Thus, investigations of mathematical understanding must look at behavior, because that is all that is observable, but should also address meaning, which requires probing beneath the simple associations to explore and make inferences about the meaning that students bring to the situation. My goal as a researcher is to understand how meaningful mathematical understanding is built and how meta-cognitive behavior can help.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concept Image</head><p>The assumption that learners build up cognitive structures as they learn mathematics requires some terms to discuss these structures. I borrow a term from <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Tall and Vinner (1981)</ref>:</p><p>We shall use the term concept image to describe the total cognitive structure that is associated with the concept, which includes all the mental pictures and associated properties and processes. It is built up over the years through experiences of all kinds, changing as the individual meets new stimuli and matures. <ref type="bibr">(p. 152)</ref> In this seminal paper, Tall and Vinner contrast the concept image with the term concept definition, which is a verbal description of the concept and about which I say more below. Because only part of a cognitive structure is brought into consciousness during a particular task, the term evoked concept image refers to that portion of the concept image that is evoked in response to a given task <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">(Tall &amp; Vinner, 1981)</ref>.</p><p>The ideas of concept image and evoked concept image are consistent with the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Hart (1994)</ref>, who found that when students approach mathematical tasks, "strategies are evoked [rather than chosen], based on the interaction between the task at hand and the current conceptual schema" (p. 61). Furthermore, he explained his results by suggesting that "processes, metacognition, and misconceptions are actually part of one's conceptual schema" (p. 62).</p><p>characterizations of a concept image. Concept images, for example, can be dominated by particular examples, representations, or ways of thinking.  observed, for example, that some students focused on the process of computing a coset, whereas more successful students were also able to conceive of cosets as objects that themselves could be acted upon by other processes. Thus, concept images can be limiting when they inhibit an individual from making certain constructions or generalizations.</p><p>A concept image is built through all previous experiences with the concept. Experiences that are assimilated make sense within the evoked concept images. Experiences that require accommodation, on the other hand, cause structural changes in an individual's concept images such as the construction of a new concept, the creation of new connections to other concepts, or the reorganization of the connections within or among concepts A key theme that emerged in this study is the complicated relationship between a concept and its name. I make only two points here and provide additional theoretical discussion below. First, a student's concept image might not reasonably be described as a subset of a mathematician's concept image. A student's concept image may instead include misconceptions or may even be of a different character entirely. Second, the notion of concept image presents something like a chicken-and-egg problem: Which comes first, the concept or the name? One might begin with the name of a concept and then gradually build experiences underneath. On the other hand, as individuals gain experience, they build mental structures that are not necessarily part of a named concept but at some point subsume those structures (and experiences) under a single name. In either scenario, at what point is there a concept image? The resolution of the problem lies in the realization that the notion of concept image is merely an analytical tool. People do not have concept images in the same sense that they have internal organs. Thus, in the analysis I try to maintain a notion of concept image that is flexible enough to accommodate all of these possibilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship to Schema</head><p>The term concept image shares some similarity with the term schema, used by Piaget and many researchers in both the constructivist and cognitive science traditions (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Bransford et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Piaget, 1970a</ref>). In the problem-solving literature, particularly in cognitive psychology, schemas are associated with problem types, and each schema has "slots" that are filled by the specific information provided in the problem. (For an overview of this literature see Mayer, 1992.) This view is problematic because it seems to suggest that learning consists of constructing a new schema for each new problem type.</p><p>For <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Dubinsky (1991)</ref>, "A schema is a more or less coherent collection of objects and processes" (p. 102), which typically might be named as a concept. For example, "The concept of group can be understood as a schema that consists of three schemas: set, binary operation, and axiom ( <ref type="bibr">Brown et al., 1997, p. 192)</ref>. For Skemp <ref type="bibr">(1987)</ref>, on the other hand, a schema is a suitably connected collection of concepts.</p><p>For the purposes of this study, I was primarily concerned with the ways that students think about particular concepts. Thus, a concept image was associated with a particular concept, typically given by name. And with the term, I considered both the way it is structured and the ways it connects to other mathematical ideas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concept Definition</head><p>As described above, <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Tall and Vinner (1981)</ref> introduced the term concept image to contrast with a concept definition, which is a form of words used to specify a concept.</p><p>This distinction serves as a reminder of two simple ideas about students' learning of mathematics. First, around any (mathematical) concept, students' thinking is strongly influenced by the examples, nonexamples, representations, and contexts in which they have previously experienced the concept. Second, students do not typically employ (or naturally adopt) the mathematical habit of consulting a formal definition in response to mathematical tasks but rather rely entirely on their concept image. <ref type="bibr">Furthermore, Vinner (1992)</ref> found that even when students can recall a concept definition, the concept definition and the concept image might conflict or contradict one another. He calls this phenomenon compartmentalization, suggesting that the concept definition and the concept image are not evoked at the same time.</p><p>Perhaps because of the phenomenon of compartmentalization, Vinner and Tall often separate the concept definition from the concept image, in describing cognitive structure (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">Vinner, 1992)</ref>, and even go so far as to discuss a "concept definition image" to describe a concept image built up around the definition <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">(Tall &amp; Vinner, 1981)</ref>. For successful mathematicians, however, a formal concept definition constitutes an integral part of the cognitive structure built around that concept. The definition is routinely consulted and is well integrated into the rest of the concept image. Thus, for this study, a concept definition (personal, formal, or otherwise; see below) was considered a subset of a concept image. In the analysis, I explored the definitions that the students provided as a means of making inferences about the nature and connectivity of their concept images.</p><p>Theoretically, including the definition as part of the concept image is reasonable even when the definition is compartmentalized, because the term concept image implies nothing about the connectivity of that structure. In fact, an individual's concept image may include several essentially separate components, each evoked for different kinds of problems.</p><p>Definitions are not easily remembered verbatim. And in everyday life, a definition's precise wording is often forgotten shortly after it is used, introduced, or consulted. When terms are introduced via a definition, the definition sometimes provides only scaffolding:</p><p>When the construction is sufficiently complete, the scaffolding is taken away. To overcome this tendency, some instructors, in mathematics as well as other subjects, recommend that students memorize definitions. But it is not at all clear to what extent mathematicians or other experts recall rather than reconstruct definitions that they use in their professional work.</p><p>Because definitions are not easily remembered, it seems likely that they are constructed, and this is the point of view that informed this study. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Tall and Vinner (1981)</ref>, a student, when asked to define a concept, may respond with a personal concept definition, which may not agree with a mathematically acceptable formal concept definition but which instead might be described as an ad hoc description of his or her concept image. Thus, some parts of the concept image function as definitions. For example, in Deborah Ball's third grade classroom, Cassandra shows that six is even by pointing to the number line: "Six can't be an odd number because this is (she points to the number line, starting with zero) even, odd, even, odd, even, odd, even" <ref type="bibr">(Ball &amp; Bass, 2000, p. 213)</ref>. For her, the alternating pattern provides the definitions of even and odd.</p><p>For other students in the class, grouping by twos serves to provide the definitions. Still other students prefer to separate numbers into two groups. As another example, the literature on the learning of functions is replete with examples of students defining function as synonymous with formula or equation (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">Vinner, 1992;</ref>. Students implicitly use personal concept definitions when asked to determine whether a particular thing is an example or a nonexample of a concept. This is reasonable behavior in contexts-including many mathematical contexts-where precise definitions are not necessary for the task at hand, particularly when one's concept image is sufficiently rich and robust. <ref type="bibr">Lakoff and Johnson (1980, pp. 117-125)</ref> point out that from a cognitive point of view, definition is not a matter of giving a list of necessary and sufficient properties for a concept, although this is sometimes possible. Instead, concepts are defined by prototypes and by types of relations to the prototypes, and there need be no fixed core of properties of the prototypes that are shared by all instances of the concept. Furthermore, some</p><p>properties of a concept are not part of the thing itself but are functional, purposive, or otherwise involve interaction with an instance of the concept. And finally, concepts are not fixed but can be systematically modified by metaphors and by hedges such as "technically" or "loosely speaking."</p><p>In advanced mathematics, on the other hand, the definition of a concept becomes primary; the definition becomes the touchstone whose role is to ensure rigor (i.e., precision and consistency) within, between, and among concept images. Because this perspective on definitions is unusual outside of mathematics and the hard sciences, it represents a significant adjustment for students. The nature and role of definitions in mathematics did not play an explicit role in the course that is the subject of this study, but because these ideas inform my analysis, the topic deserves more attention here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Types of Definitions</head><p>Linguists distinguish among several types of definitions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Kemerling, 2001)</ref>. A lexical definition is an attempt to describe the meaning of a word as it is commonly used. These are the kinds of definitions found in dictionaries, which, contrary to some beliefs, portray current usage not timeless truths, in full acknowledgement that languages evolve. A stipulative definition, on the other hand, specifies what a term is to denote. Such definitions are commonly found in technical, legal, and scholarly writing. From the viewpoint of some writers, a stipulative definition freely assigns meaning to a new term and thus is intended to be the touchstone for all subsequent uses of the term.</p><p>Nonetheless, the expositor is somewhat constrained by what the reader might be willing to accept. Thus, one common approach is to use a precising definition, which begins with a lexical definition of a term, and then proposes to sharpen it by stipulating more narrow limits on its use.</p><p>Theoretical definitions are stipulative definitions made within the context of a broader intellectual framework. It is worth noting that the validity of a theory depends upon the definitions on which the theory is built. Thus, an appropriate interpretation of Newton's laws of motion, for example, depends upon imposing particular definitions of terms such as mass, inertia, and force onto experience. For example, I presume that separating the concept of weight into mass and acceleration due to gravity was a major conceptual advance. When they were introduced, Newton's particular set of definitions provided an extremely elegant description of objects in motion. But one should recognize that the precise definitions were required for the creation of the theory. It seems backward to teach students the theory only to conclude later that they have misconceptions about some of the terms. Why not instead try to provide them with experiences that will help them see the importance of precise definitions and the usefulness of particular definitions and of the distinctions among them?</p><p>Formal definitions in mathematics are, in a way, peculiar precising definitions-peculiar because of the inflexible totality of the implied precision (i.e., no more, no less) and because the formal definition sometimes bears little relationship to the term's informal usage (e.g., "cycle"). This use of definitions may be peculiar to mathematics and the hard sciences. In the social sciences, precise definitions are hard to find. Rather, an idea is given a name (often a common word), and then the researcher spends paragraphs describing what does and does not fit under the name.</p><p>In the analysis of the data in this study, I followed Vinner (1976) and restricted my attention to formal and lexical definitions to discuss the two primary roles that definitions play in mathematics and mathematics learning, but it is worth pointing out that in the above discussion I have presented stipulative definitions of several terms including concept image and stipulative definition itself. None of these, however, carries the precision of formal mathematical definitions. I believe that such precision is not possible because ideas about language and cognition are messy, fuzzy, and dependent upon the phenomena that the definitions are intended to describe. Mathematical ideas, on the other hand, are ideal-abstracted from phenomena and no longer dependent on the "real world," at least in formal mathematical practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definitions in Mathematical Practice</head><p>"When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said, in a rather scornful tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean-neither more nor less." <ref type="bibr">(Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass)</ref> In the words of <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Polya (1957)</ref>, the "definition of a term is a statement of its meaning in other terms which are supposed to be well known" (p. 85). But this seemingly innocuous statement hides four crucial aspects of the role of definitions in mathematics: the creation of meaning, the need for undefined terms, the substitution criterion, and the use of mental or physical models. These are discussed, in turn, below.</p><p>"The mathematician is not concerned with the current meaning of his technical terms….</p><p>The mathematical definition creates the mathematical meaning" <ref type="bibr">(Polya, 1957, p. 86)</ref>.</p><p>This view of definitions, embodied in the character of Humpty Dumpty above, reached its height in the formalism of Russell, Whitehead, Peacock, Hilbert, and others, but in fact, has its early roots in Kant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">3</ref> Formalists maintain that mathematics involves manipulating meaningless symbols according to the formal rules of the system, and the primary criterion is that the system is consistent. Of course, this point of view requires certain ontological and epistemological commitments or at least changes in perspective.</p><p>Hamilton, for example, insisted that the symbols must stand for something 'real'-if not material objects, then mental constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Kleiner, 1987)</ref>. Nonetheless, some mathematicians were reluctant to adopt a formalist view. Graves, for example, on</p><p>Hamilton's invention of the quaternions, responded, "I have not yet any clear view as to the extent to which we are at liberty to create imaginaries, and to endow them with supernatural properties" (quoted in <ref type="bibr">Kleiner, 1987, p. 233)</ref>. By 1844, however, less than a year after Hamilton had published his work on quaternions, Graves and other mathematicians begin creating new mathematical structures almost without restraint. 4</p><p>It is well known that in any mathematical system some terms must be taken as primitive, that is, left undefined, for the only alternatives are circular definitions or infinite regress, neither of which is logically tolerable. If one accepts that definitions create the meaning of terms, where, then, do undefined terms acquire their meaning? Just as the axioms of natural numbers form implicit definitions of natural numbers <ref type="bibr">(Beth &amp; Piaget, 1966, p.</ref> 68), the axioms of any mathematical system give implicit definitions of the undefined terms of that system. Couturat made this point by distinguishing between direct definition and definition by postulates, the latter applying not to a single notion but a system of notions (cited in <ref type="bibr">Poincaré, 1946, p. 453)</ref>.</p><p>To adhere to the principle that all assumptions must be made explicit in the axioms and definitions, Pascal was apparently the first to put forward the criterion of substitution:</p><p>that the definition permits us "to substitute the definition in place of the defined" (cited in <ref type="bibr">Beth &amp; Piaget, 1966, p. 38</ref>). Thus, the substitution principle is a way of ensuring that every theorem and every proof could, in principle, be written using only the undefined terms, the axioms, and the laws of logic. <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Mariotti and Fischbein (1997)</ref> clarify the implications of this view:</p><p>In the new theory, it is not possible to prove anything which was not already possible to prove in the old one. From the formal point of view, a definition does not enlarge the power of the theory. A definition is rather a correct definition just because it can be eliminated. (p. 222)</p><p>And although this extreme formalism is rarely carried out, the first substitution is a standard mathematical practice. In other words, when proving theorems about a newly defined mathematical concept, the standard approach is to replace the term by its definition. Polya (1957) calls this process "the elimination of technical terms" by "going back to definitions" (p. 89).</p><p>If the axioms and the definitions are to be the source of meaning within a mathematical system, then the implication is that all proofs and formal reasoning should proceed from the axioms, definitions, and previously proven theorems. This is what is meant by mathematical rigor. Because physical and mental models of the system might carry meaning that does not follow from the axioms and definitions, such models cannot be trusted and thus are inadmissible in proofs. The validity of a proof is independent of the meaning of the descriptive terms. To emphasize this point, Hilbert once said, "One must be able to say at all times-instead of points, straight lines, and planes-tables, chairs, and beer mugs" <ref type="bibr">(Reid, 1986, p. 57</ref>). The implication is that no matter how the terms are interpreted, a counterexample will never be produced <ref type="bibr">(Lakatos, 1976, p. 100)</ref>. Taken to an extreme, the formalist approach identifies mathematics with metamathematics and with logic, resulting in a rather bleak picture:</p><p>The subject matter of metamathematics is an abstraction of mathematics in which mathematical theories are replaced by formal systems, proofs by certain sequences of well-formed formulae, definitions by "abbreviatory devices" which are "theoretically dispensable" but "typographically convenient." (Lakatos, 1976, p. 1, drawing on Church, Peano, Russell, Whitehead, and Pascal)</p><p>But even Russell (1938) admits:</p><p>It is a curious paradox, puzzling to the symbolic mind, that definitions, theoretically, are nothing but statements of symbolic abbreviations, irrelevant to the reasoning and inserted only for practical convenience, while yet, in the development of a subject, they always require a very large amount of thought, and often embody some of the greatest achievements of analysis. (p. 63)</p><p>Thus, despite the formalism and the claim to disregard meaning, thinking and meaning remain crucial characteristics of mathematical activity. It is true that the words are symbolic abbreviations, but the concepts for which they stand (and hence the meaning that they are intended to carry) took time to formulate and constitute significant human achievements.</p><p>When one acknowledges the importance of both rigor and meaning, perhaps it is not surprising that most mathematicians are Platonists on weekdays and formalists on the weekends (P. J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Davis &amp; Hersh, 1981)</ref>, seeking to discover timeless mathematical truths and simultaneously adhering to meaningless formalism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definitions in the History of Mathematics</head><p>The history of mathematics is full of examples where the definitions changed in order to correct for unintended consequences, including such "simple" concepts as function, continuity, and polyhedron (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Lakatos, 1976)</ref>. Much of the history of mathematics has been spent trying to figure out what the concepts are, trying to "get the definitions right," so that they correspond to the intuitions that the mathematicians had in mind.</p><p>We begin with a vague concept in our minds, then we create various sets of postulates, and gradually we settle down to one particular set. In the rigorous postulational approach the original concept is now replaced by what the postulates define. This makes further evolution of the concept rather difficult and as a result tends to slow down the evolution of mathematics. It is not that the postulation approach is wrong, only that its arbitrariness should be clearly recognized, and we should be prepared to change postulates when the need becomes apparent. <ref type="bibr">(Hamming, 1980, p. 86)</ref> The process of "gradually settling down" on a definition deserves elaboration. Drawing on <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Lakatos (1976)</ref>, the process goes something like this:</p><p>• Get a mathematical idea that can form the beginning of a concept.</p><p>• Create an informal definition that seems to describe the concept.</p><p>• Formalize that definition.</p><p>• Reason from that definition to determine what it implies: Create some examples; prove some theorems; look for equivalent or closely related characterizations of the concept.</p><p>• Modify the formal definition to exclude undesired consequences.</p><p>• Alternatively, enlarge or otherwise alter one's understandings and intuitions of the concept to accommodate these newfound possibilities.</p><p>There are several points to make about this process. First, sometimes the modifications to the definition amount to little more than eliminating undesirable examples through ad hoc redefinitions, a seemingly nonmathematical practice Lakatos (1976) called monster barring.</p><p>Second, the process incorporates apparent contradictions on the role of definitions: On the one hand, the definition is taken to create a mathematical object and to give a term its meaning. And on the other hand, the definition is carefully chosen to capture a specific meaning and with an instrumental or expository purpose. Because both of these roles are mathematically indispensable, their relationship is better viewed as dialectical.</p><p>Third, once agreement is reached, a definition can be taken as primary-as though it had been handed down on stone tablets. In the deductivist, definition-theorem-proof format of much mathematical presentation and exposition, the dialectical evolution of the concept and its definition are subsequently ignored.</p><p>In deductivist style, all propositions are true and all inferences valid. Mathematics is presented as an ever-increasing set of eternal, immutable truths…. Deductivist style hides the struggle, hides the adventure. The whole story vanishes, the successive tentative formulations of the theorem in the course of the proof-procedure are doomed to oblivion while the end result is exalted into sacred infallibility. 5 <ref type="bibr">(Lakatos, 1976, p. 142)</ref> Such strict adherence to formalism is to ignore the history of mathematics, rendering the teacher and students blind to important epistemological obstacles and ignorant of required changes in perspective. And not only are students deprived of opportunities to see and benefit from the growth of particular definitions, they are thus also deprived of opportunities to appreciate the evolution of the role of definition in mathematics.</p><p>It should not be at all surprising that students have difficulty accepting the role of definitions in modern mathematics when it was not fundamental in until the nineteenth century.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definitions and Mathematical Intuition</head><p>By relaxing the demands of pure formalism, one can adopt a position in which intuition and meaning are central to mathematical activity but where logic and rigor are available as tools for verification. As Hadamard said, "The object of mathematical rigor is to sanction and legitimize the conquests of intuition, and there never was any other object for it" (cited in <ref type="bibr">Ahlfors et al., 1962, p. 192)</ref>. Despite the rhetoric of formalism and rigor, it seems that metaphorical thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">(Sfard, 1994)</ref> and intuition remain central:</p><p>It is significant that when a mathematician reads a theorem which conflicts with his intuitive expectations his first move is to doubt not his intuition but the proof. He trusts his intuition more. If after having checked the proof carefully he becomes convinced that it is correct, he then inquires into what may be wrong with his intuition. <ref type="bibr">(Kline, 1973, p. 160)</ref> Thurston (1994) acknowledges putting "a lot of effort into 'listening' to my intuitions and associations, and building them into metaphors and connections" (p. 165). He discusses <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Lakatos condemned mathematics and science education as a hotbed of authoritarianism and as the worst enemy of critical thought <ref type="bibr">(Lakatos, 1976, pp. 142-143, note 2)</ref>. the relationships among definition, understanding, and intuition by presenting several characterizations of the concept of derivative:</p><p>(1) Infinitesimal: the ratio of the infinitesimal change in the value of a function to the infinitesimal change in a function.</p><p>(2) Symbolic: the derivative of x n is nx n -1 , the derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), the derivative of is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">' , etc. g f o ' g g f * o (3) Logical:</formula><p>if and only if for every ε there is a δ such that when</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">d x f = ) ( ' δ &lt; ∆ &lt; x 0 , δ &lt; − ∆ − ∆ + d x x f x x f ) ( ) ( [sic].</formula><p>(4) Geometric: the derivative is the slope of a line tangent to the graph of the function, if the graph has a tangent.</p><p>(5) Rate: the instantaneous speed of f(t), when t is time.</p><p>(6) Approximation: The derivative of a function is the best linear approximation to the function near a point.</p><p>(7) Microscopic: The derivative of a function is the limit of what you get by looking at it under a microscope of higher and higher power. This is a list of different ways of thinking about or conceiving of the derivative rather than a list of logical definitions. Unless great efforts are made to maintain the tone and flavor of the original human insights, the differences start to evaporate as soon as the mental objects are translated into precise, formal and explicit definitions.</p><p>I can remember absorbing each of these concepts as something new and interesting, and spending a good deal of mental time and effort digesting and practicing with each, reconciling it with the others. I also remember coming back to revisit these different concepts later with added meaning and understanding….</p><p>The list continues; there is no reason for it ever to stop. A sample entry further down the list may help illustrate this. We may think we know all there is to say about a certain subject, but new insights are around the corner. Despite the fact that Thurston's 37 characterizations are not definitions, for him they may function as definitions in reasoning within certain problem settings, though perhaps without the precision of a formal definition. From his use of words such as flavor, tone, and insight, it is clear that these characterizations are full of meaning for Thurston. And it is worth emphasizing that attempting to formalize these ways of thinking runs the risk of changing their character and perhaps their usefulness in reasoning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definitions and Learning Mathematical Concepts</head><p>Drawing on the history and expository literature discussed above, I take the position that meaning is central to mathematical learning and mathematical thought and that careful reasoning from precise definitions is an important capability to be cultivated in mathematics majors. What, then, is the relationship between definitions and learning? <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Skemp (1987)</ref> proposes two principles for teaching mathematical concepts:</p><p>1. Concepts of a higher order than those which people already have cannot be communicated to them by a definition, but only by arranging for them to encounter a suitable collection of examples.</p><p>2. Since in mathematics these examples are almost invariably other concepts, it must first be ensured that these are already formed in the mind of the learner. (p. 18)</p><p>Skemp does not indicate how or when he came to these sensible conclusions or what sort of empirical data support them. But from the preceding discussion, it should be clear that mathematicians are distinguished by their ability to violate the first of these principles, and it appears that Halmos, at least, transcends the second principle by constructing his own examples: "A good stock of examples, as large as possible, is indispensable for a thorough understanding of any concept, and when I want to learn something new, I make it my first job to build one" (cited in <ref type="bibr">Gallian, 1994, p. 34</ref>).</p><p>Thus, learning to violate or transcend these principles is a requirement for entering into the mathematical community. Specifically, a student pursuing a degree in mathematics must learn to build understanding (and perhaps create the examples) by reasoning from a definition. But here we have a conflict: On the one hand, students must learn to reason from the definitions rather than exclusively from their concept images because pictures, metaphors, and informal understandings are sometimes unreliable. On the other hand, the source of their reasoning may continue to be the models and metaphors that they keep in mind.</p><p>Conflicts between the empirical (lexical) approach and the theoretical approach can represent a real obstacle for the students' understanding. That is the reason why the problem of introducing pupils to the mathematical process of defining constitutes a crucial point in mathematics education, which needs to be faced directly. <ref type="bibr">(Mariotti &amp; Fischbein, 1997, p. 226)</ref> Adopting a formalistic approach to definitions may require epistemological and ontological changes in perspective. Suffice it to say that these changes in approach and perspective are rarely made explicit to the student. It is possible that successful mathematicians learned to reason from the definitions without ever being aware of these changes in perspective. And by the time they are teaching courses to undergraduates, this approach has become so natural that they do not realize that nothing has changed for the student.</p><p>From the naïve student's point of view, definitions are lexical: They are used to describe or explain ideas that already exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">(Vinner, 1976)</ref>. But as concepts expand, become more general, and allow inclusion of never-before-imagined examples, the natural meaning gets lost. What does it take to understand the importance of formal reasoning, which includes reasoning from definitions?</p><p>Students do not understand the role of mathematical definitions in general and, in particular, do not know how to reason from definitions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Mariotti and Fischbein (1997)</ref> found, like Vinner, that students may know the definition and yet fail to correctly identify whether objects satisfy the definition because the "concepts are often, implicitly or explicitly, distorted by gestalts" (p. 244). These distortions can take the form of additional conditions that remain implicit. They suggest that "in empirical domains, one tends to adapt the definitions to the empirical data-and exceptions are admissible"</p><p>(p. 245).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Borasi's Work</head><p>Some of the most fully elaborated work on learning the nature and role of mathematical definitions comes from Borasi. In Learning Mathematics Through Inquiry <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Borasi, 1992)</ref>, she presents a detailed analysis of a "mini-course" with two high school students.</p><p>Although she had broad mathematical goals, she chose to focus on the notion of definition because it "presents a beautiful example of the more humanistic and contextualized aspects of mathematics" (p. 7).</p><p>Before presenting any of the data or analysis, she sets forth five criteria for definitions:</p><p>• Precision in terminology. All the terms employed in the definition should have been previously defined, unless they are one of the few undefined terms assumed as a starting point in the axiomatic system one is working with.</p><p>• Isolation of the concept. All instances of a concept must meet all the requirements stated in its definition, while a noninstance will not satisfy at least one of them.</p><p>• Essentiality. Only terms and properties that are strictly necessary to distinguish the concept in question from others should be explicitly mentioned in the definition.</p><p>• Noncontradiction. All the properties stated in a definition should be able to coexist.</p><p>• Noncircularity. The definition should not use the term it is trying to define. <ref type="bibr">(Borasi, 1992, pp. 17-18)</ref> She then points out that these criteria stem, in part, from the fact that we want a definition to:</p><p>1. Allow us to discriminate between instances and noninstances of the concept with certainty, consistency, and efficiency (by simply checking whether a potential candidate satisfies all the properties stated in the definition).</p><p>2. "Capture" and synthesize the mathematical essence of the concept (all the properties belonging to the concept should be logically derivable from those included in its definition). (p. 18)</p><p>During the mini-course the students wrote, created, and modified definitions, extended definitions to new domains, and constructed definitions in new contexts, such as taxicab geometry. In one of the activities, inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Lakatos's (1976)</ref> example of the evolution of the definition of polyhedron, Borasi asked the students to construct a definition of polygon, believing that such an experience "could help students appreciate that definitions are really created by us, even in mathematics, where everything may seem rigid and predetermined (at least to most students)" <ref type="bibr">(Borasi, 1992, p. 44)</ref>.</p><p>Based upon her analysis, Borasi concludes that the students changed their conceptions not only of mathematical definitions but also of mathematics. Through the experience, she also changed her view of mathematical definition, realizing a deeper understanding of the role of context and purpose in the creation and evaluation of mathematical definitions.</p><p>Furthermore, she reconsidered the role of her five criteria set forth above, for those criteria are satisfactory only in specific mathematical contexts when it is reasonable to imagine the definition is fixed. When the context changes, however, the criteria must be relaxed, at least for a moment, and the definition may change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Which Definition?</head><p>Which of the various equivalent formulations of a concept is chosen as its definition?</p><p>The choice is not arbitrary, despite the formalist claim to the contrary. In a formal presentation of a concept, the definition that is chosen is usually the one that is most elegant or most useful in proofs concerning the concept, which implies that it is formal and often that it is minimal and otherwise concise. In a pedagogical presentation, a definition is chosen with a particular pedagogical purpose. <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Poincaré (1946)</ref> makes it clear that the choices should not be the same:</p><p>What is a good definition? For the philosopher or the scientist it is a definition which applies to the objects defined, and only those; it is the one satisfying the rules of logic. But in teaching it is not that; a good definition is one understood by the scholars <ref type="bibr">[students]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">(p. 430)</ref> This view toward formalism was echoed by 75 mathematicians who, responding to the excesses of the new math, warned that "premature formalization may lead to sterility"</p><p>( <ref type="bibr">Ahlfors et al., 1962, p. 190)</ref>.</p><p>From the mathematics education community, Mariotti and Fischbein warn that "the formal approach does not grasp the very process of defining" (p. 222) and suggest, instead that definitions have a constructive and creative role and actually bring new concepts into existence. They propose that "a definition is to be considered a 'good' definition as far as the new object starts to live by itself and may become the subject of a new theory" (p. 223).</p><p>There seems to be very little discussion in the literature about the problem of conflicting definitions, other than occasionally mentioning that parallelograms are sometimes but not always included as trapezoids. What is rarely acknowledged is that there are also conflicting definitions of natural number (including vs. omitting 0), ring (including vs. omitting 1), and integral domain (including vs. omitting commutativity). Thus, although a particular definition may be chosen with a particular expository or pedagogical purpose, there is a certain arbitrariness in which objects are thus defined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definitions in Textbooks</head><p>How are definitions treated in mathematical texts? Explicit definitions can send implicit messages about the role of definitions in mathematics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Raman (1998)</ref> found that texts send conflicting messages about the purpose and use of mathematical definitions. Vinner <ref type="bibr">(1991)</ref> suggests that mathematics textbooks and classroom practice are partly based on the following assumptions:</p><p>1. Concepts are mainly acquired by means of their definitions.</p><p>2. Students will use definitions to solve problems and prove theorems.</p><p>3. Definitions should be minimal.</p><p>4. It is desirable that definitions will be elegant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Definitions are arbitrary. (pp. 65-66)</head><p>What conclusions do students draw from such implicit messages? <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Rin (1982)</ref> found that students do not understand that the definition is to be the official source of information about the concept and that textbooks sometimes compound the problem by burying definitions in the text or the exercises, or by leaving implicit the quantifiers or the appropriate range of the variables.</p><p>Would it be better if texts were explicit about the nature and role of definitions in mathematics? Textbooks are rarely explicit about the role of definition, although some texts emphasize that all definitions are "if and only if" statements (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Fraleigh, 1989, p. 3;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bittinger, 1982, p. 40)</ref>, and a few point out that a definition is an abbreviation (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Bittinger, 1982, p. 40)</ref>. But these are statements about what a definition is, which is singularly unhelpful to students, who believe they already know what definitions are and implicitly operate on this basis <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">(Vinner, 1976)</ref>. Instead, students need to learn what to do with definitions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>Definitions play opposing roles in mathematical thinking and learning, serving simultaneously to describe and support informal mathematical intuition and meaning and to create meaning through the imposition of formalism. These opposing roles are evident in the history of mathematics, in the evolution of definitions of key concepts, in mathematics textbooks, and in research into students' use of definitions in mathematical learning. In order to accommodate both of these roles into descriptions of students'</p><p>understandings of concepts in abstract algebra, I took a broad view of definitions, with the aim of capturing both meaning and level of precision. Thus, the analysis included not only students' attempts at formal definitions but also the ad hoc personal definitions they provided when I asked for the meaning of a term or statement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstraction Versus Generalization</head><p>Mathematically, a definition creates meaning for a new concept, but psychologically, new concepts are created through processes of abstraction and generalization. Abstraction and generalization are fundamental human activities that become critically important in advanced mathematics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Dreyfus (1991)</ref> suggests, for example, that the ability to consciously make abstractions from mathematical situations "may well be the single most important goal of advanced mathematical education" (p. 34). I begin with abstraction, which played a central role during the new math era. Here is one view from that era:</p><p>The process of abstraction is defined as the process of drawing from a number of different situations something which is common to them all. Logically speaking it is an inductive process; it consists of a search for an attribute which would describe certain elements felt somehow to belong together….</p><p>For example the forming of the concept of the natural number two is an abstraction process, as it consists mainly of experiences of pairs of objects of the greatest possible diversity, all properties of such objects being ignored except that of being distinct from each other and from other objects. The essential common property of all such pairs of objects is the natural number two. <ref type="bibr">(Dienes, 1961, pp. 281-282)</ref> Piaget distinguishes between empirical abstraction, which starts from perceived objects, and reflective abstraction, which starts from actions and operations <ref type="bibr">(Beth &amp; Piaget, 1966, pp. 188-189)</ref>.</p><p>As an adjective, abstract is usually contrasted with concrete. Wilensky (1991) points out, however, that concreteness is not a property of an object but a property of a person's relationship to an object. Concreteness, he suggests, measures the degree of our relatedness to the object (the richness of our representations, interactions, connections with the object), how close we are to it, or the quality of our relationship with the object.</p><p>Thus, any object can become concrete for someone. He notes that this point of view turns the old definition of concrete on its head, so that thinking concretely is not narrow but rather opens up a whole world of ideas and relationships. Frorer, Hazzan, and Manes (1997) agree with Wilensky and suggest two additional themes in abstraction: ignoring details and thinking of things in terms of properties rather than actual components.</p><p>As for generalization, it should be mentioned that generalization and abstraction are often confounded in the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Dreyfus, 1991)</ref> and are sometimes treated as essentially synonymous (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Beth &amp; Piaget, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Vygotsky, 1934</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Vygotsky, /1986</ref>). 6 Tall (1991) suggests, however, that generalization simply involves an extension of familiar processes whereas abstraction requires mental reorganization. Thus, generalization is the application of an existing process or structure to a broader class of objects (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Dienes, 1961</ref>).</p><p>Generalization may be contrasted with specialization, where the scope of a process or structure is restricted in some way. Abstraction, on the other hand, creates a new structure on a higher level, which is not a deduction but a construction process.</p><p>Abstraction may be contrasted with exemplification, which creates a specific instance of the abstract structure or idea. A mathematical metaphor may help make the distinction more clear: Generalization and specialization are about creating supersets and subsets;</p><p>abstraction is about constructing a new kind of set and exemplification involves choosing an element of that set. In mathematical thinking, of course, abstraction and generalization may be operating simultaneously or consecutively. It is not always possible, however, to separate the two processes, such as in the introduction of the notation of an asterisk '*' to serve generally for an abstract binary operation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Processes Versus Objects</head><p>One of the central theoretical themes in advanced mathematical thinking is the distinction between process and object conceptions of mathematical ideas. Although the terminology is diverse, the primary distinction is that a process is an activity carried out through some sort of procedure, whereas an object can be conceived of as a single entity.</p><p>Many mathematical ideas can be conceived both as processes and as objects, so the distinction is psychological. <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">Sfard (1991)</ref> distinguishes between operational and structural conceptions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Harel and Kaput (1991)</ref> distinguish between a process and a conceptual entity. Dubinsky and his colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Dubinsky, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Breidenbach, Dubinsky, Hawks, &amp; Nichols, 1992)</ref> also distinguish between processes and objects and offer additional categories described above. In reviewing this literature, Tall, Thomas, G.</p><p>Davis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">Gray, and Simpson (2000)</ref> suggest that it is possible to ascertain whether students have constructed a mental object based on the way they talk and write about the concept.</p><p>Object conceptions allow for descriptive discourse and attention to structural features of the mathematical ideas. Process conceptions, on the other hand, are confined to narrative discourse.</p><p>There are some differences among the perspectives of these researchers, but they are in agreement that a learner cannot meaningfully act on a process with another process until the former has become an object in his or her mind. This kind of mental construction is called encapsulation (or reification, or entification). For some concepts, encapsulation seems to be extremely difficult for most students, and coset may be one such concept, as suggested in the literature review above.</p><p>On the other hand, there are "natural," implicit instances of encapsulation. For example, from a process of counting, a young child creates an understanding of "4" as an object that describes what is the same about the wheels on a car, the legs on a dog, and the sides of a rectangle. To emphasize the ambiguity in the symbolism for mathematical ideas, <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Gray and Tall (1994)</ref> coined the term procept. Thus, "4 + 5" is a symbol that simultaneously denotes both the process of addition and object that results. In abstract algebra, given a subgroup H and a group element a, the notation aH simultaneously specifies the process for calculating the cosets of H and the result of one of those calculations for the particular value a.</p><p>Gray and <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Tall (1994)</ref> further distinguish between a procedure, where the focus is on step- by-step details, and a process, where the concern is with the result (as dependent on the initial state). A procedure, in other words, refers to a specific algorithm for carrying out a process. The process of addition, for example, can be carried out by many different procedures, including counting all, counting on, or pressing buttons on a calculator.</p><p>Similarly, there are many procedures that can be constructed to determine whether a subgroup is normal, but any (or all) of them may be conceptualized as the process for determining normality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metaphor</head><p>Drawing on the work of <ref type="bibr">Núñez (1997, 2000</ref>), I take the position that This mathematical notion depends upon its everyday version, the Role-for-Individual metonymy, by which we are able to imagine carrying out actions with whoever (or whatever) fills the required role.</p><p>Because algebra in general and abstract algebra in particular are about essence, Lakoff and Núñez (2000) discuss the Folk Theory of Essences, which includes such notions as "everything is a specific kind of thing" (p. 107), "kinds are categories" (p. 108), and "the essence of a thing is an inherent part of that thing" (p. 108). Essence is characterized by three metaphors: Essences Are Substances, Essences Are Forms, and Essences Are Patterns of Change. The Folk Theory of Essences was behind Aristotle's definition of definition as a "list of properties that are both necessary and sufficient for something to be the kind of thing that it is, and from which all its natural behavior flows" (p. 109) and also behind Euclid's axiomatic (or postulational) approach.</p><p>Building on the metaphor Essences Are Forms, <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Lakoff and Núñez (2000)</ref> put forward a foundational metaphor for abstract algebra: The essence of a mathematical system is an abstract algebraic structure, which is taken to include the elements in the structure, the operations used on those elements, and the essential properties of the operations (p. 111).</p><p>I accept their guiding principles and much of their analysis, but regarding abstract algebra, their analysis falls short on two counts. First, their notion of a mathematical structure is too restrictive because mathematical structures do not always have operations.</p><p>Second, some of their metaphors are backwards in the sense that the source domain is less familiar and more abstract than the target domain it is intended to describe.</p><p>For example, they claim, in effect, that Z 3 is the abstract group with three elements.</p><p>While this is a true statement, it is not a helpful metaphor. Furthermore, their description of the abstract group with three elements uses the set {I, A, B} with the expected operation table. This group, it is important to note, is not the abstract group itself but a particular representation of it-a representation, moreover, that does not easily support calculation. If abstract concepts are metaphorical, as they claim, then the appropriate metaphor is that the abstract group with three elements is Z 3 , thereby providing a familiar instantiation of the abstraction. This metaphor does not provide a complete characterization of the abstract group, however, because it leaves out the necessary abstraction. Where do abstractions come from, and by what process do they come about?</p><p>Unfortunately, the process of abstraction (abstracting) is conspicuously missing from their analysis, although the results of abstractions are covered in their Folk Theory of Essences.</p><p>To remedy the analysis provided by Lakoff and Núñez, it is necessary first to broaden the notion of structure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Rickart (1995)</ref> suggests that there is "not much hope for stating in a few lines a precise and complete definition of structure" (p. 11). In its place, he suggests, puts forward "an admittedly imprecise approximate definition, which is then elaborated and made increasingly more complete through examples and explanations" (p. 11).</p><p>Rickart's definition is the following: "A structure is any set of objects (also called elements) along with certain relations among those objects" (p. 17, emphasis in original).</p><p>The advantage of this definition over that of Lakoff and Núñez is that it can accommodate topological and order structures. Furthermore, it is consistent with the notion of structure in fields outside mathematics, such as linguistics, psychology, biology, and anthropology <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Rickart, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">see also Piaget, 1970b</ref>).</p><p>Algebraic structures fit this definition by way of an appropriate interpretation of the relations among the objects. A group is a structure, for example, in that the objects are the elements and the relation is a ternary relation defined in terms of the group operation:</p><p>The group elements in an ordered triple (g, h, k) are related if gh = k. <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Rickart, 1995,</ref> p. 53) The group axioms can be also be specified as relations.</p><p>Analysis of the concepts in group theory, focusing primarily on language, leads to the conclusion that group theory is guided primarily by two metaphors:</p><p>• Groups Are Sets</p><p>• Groups Are Structures At first sight, these do not appear to be metaphors at all but would be more accurately characterized as obvious statements of fact. A group, after all, is a set. But sets and structures are themselves metaphors, which may be traced back to metaphors that are grounded in bodily experience. With the above definitions of structure as a set of elements with relations among them, it is possible to reduce this to one metaphor: Groups Are Structures. A guiding principle behind the concept of structure, however, is that a structure is independent of the elements themselves, depending only on the relations. For this reason and because the Groups-Are-Sets metaphor is so predominant, it makes sense to consider it separately.</p><p>The metaphor Groups Are Sets is quickly grounded through the Sets-Are-Containers metaphor, hence groups are containers. This metaphorical thinking becomes apparent in expressions such as "an element g in a group G." When a set is closed under an operation, as all groups are, the container is metaphorically closed, preventing the elements from escaping. The Groups-Are-Containers metaphor takes a slightly different character in the question "Where does this element live?" suggesting a Containers-Are- Territories metaphor that becomes particularly apparent when the group is the domain or codomain of a homomorphism.</p><p>The metaphor Groups Are Structures becomes apparent in the etymological derivation of the term isomorphism as meaning "same form." The metaphor of structure also suggests that the form is in some sense incomplete, providing only the framework that is the relations among the elements. The elements themselves are unimportant details. When a particular set under a particular operation is said to be a group, it is the operation that provides the structure, by sitting metaphorically above the elements and imposing form on the relations among them.</p><p>In constructing the above definition of structure and structuralism that applies across diverse fields, <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Rickart (1995)</ref> observes, "The objective of a structuralist approach to a subject is to extract the essential information from the background of irrelevant or unimportant information" (p. 19). Thus, structures are also essences. And since "essence" and "essentially" share the root essens (Latin present participle of esse, "to be"), the merged concepts of structure and essence is revealed in the semantic equivalence between the statements "the groups are essentially the same" and "the groups have the same structure."</p><p>By building metaphors on top of metaphors, abstraction on top of abstraction, it is possible to create hierarchical chains of metaphors that ultimately depend upon grounding metaphors. What, then, is the metaphorical relationship between essence and structure in mathematics? On the one hand, structures are essences, but on the other hand, the essence of a mathematical system is its structure. This is not circular reasoning, however, but an example of a conceptual blend, where two concepts combine to form a deeper unified concept while also contributing to a more flexible understanding of each of the concepts individually. The conceptual blend Numbers Are Points on a Line, for example, beginning with Descartes, paved the way for profound connections between geometry and algebra. Thus, structures are essences and vice versa. Saying structures are essences highlights the push toward abstraction that is a guiding principle behind the structuralist approach. Saying mathematical essences are structures, on the other hand, gives body and form to an otherwise ethereal concept.</p><p>Consider the definition of a structure as a set with relations, along with the metaphor Structures Are Essences and the three metaphors that characterize essence: Essences Are Substances, Essences Are Forms, and Essences Are Patterns of Change. Taken together these metaphors reaffirm the point made in chapter 1 that mathematics can fit under any of the three themes in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Devlin's (2000)</ref> characterization that "modern mathematics is about abstract patterns, abstract structures, and abstract relationships" (p. 136).</p><p>This discussion provides but a preliminary analysis of the metaphorical nature of the concept of group. Group theory involves many more concepts, some of which are discussed metaphorically in the analysis that follows. I note here only a few key metaphors that informed this study: Subgroups are subsets, homomorphisms are functions, cosets are sets, and sets are objects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Naming and Notation</head><p>Thus far, I have discussed concepts and their definitions, and certainly mathematical thinking and discourse require concepts and definitions. But students often use language and notation incorrectly. <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Rin (1982)</ref> suggests that students' linguistic misbehaviors are interpretable as reflective of deficient understanding or of deficient expressive powers (p. 10). Mathematical learning requires not only constructing concepts but also learning the standard names and notations for those concepts and the appropriate verbal and mathematical syntax for referring to those concepts in mathematical discourse. In this study, issues of naming and notation were central, as they are key components of the larger issues of language and representation.</p><p>One commonly advocated approach for teaching that promotes understanding is to provide opportunities for students to explore concepts before giving the concept a name (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Leron &amp; Dubinsky, 1995)</ref>. After the students have had sufficient experience and have noticed certain regularities, the relevant concepts can be given names. The naming itself is seen as unproblematic. As the mathematician John H. Conway <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(1995, April 13)</ref> once said when discussing whether spherical geometry is a non-Euclidean geometry, "This is the sort of question that bugs me! Being about names, it's not a mathematical <ref type="bibr">[sic]</ref>, so 'the answer' really doesn't matter."</p><p>But this study and at least one other <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Lajoie &amp; Mura, 2000</ref>) suggest that attaching the name is sometimes not as simple as supposed. As part of a larger study into the learning of abstract algebra, Lajoie and Mura found that when asked about cyclic groups, students seemed to focus on metaphors of coming back to the start, cycles, and images of circles.</p><p>Most students did not consider infinite cyclic groups to be cyclic because "you don't come back." Lajoie and Mura propose several sources of confusion: inappropriate use of mathematical definition, semantic contamination from everyday language <ref type="bibr">(a la Pimm, 1987)</ref>, confusion with cyclic permutations, and nonstandard definitions of powers and generators. They point out, first, that incorrect conceptions can lead to correct answers for many questions about Z n and, second, that in the history of group theory, Ruffini, Cauchy, and Jordan used similar imprecise "circular" language and excluded infinite cyclic groups. As possible solutions, they suggest drawing students' attention to differences between mathematical and ordinary uses of words and explicit teaching of the role of definition in mathematics.</p><p>The question here is, What is the relationship between a concept and its name? What is gained by giving a collection of physical or mental entities a name? How is thinking constrained by the particular name chosen? Given the name of a new concept, what understanding do students associate with that name and how? These uncertainties imply that the notion of concept image must be applied flexibly in the analysis to allow for the possibility of nonstandard connections between concepts and names.</p><p>Similar questions may be asked regarding mathematical notation. As mentioned above, students often use mathematical notation improperly in abstract algebra <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(Selden &amp; Selden, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Hazzan, 1994)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Mason and Pimm (1984)</ref> suggest that students' difficulty may be caused partly by ambiguity in the notation itself. What, for example, does 2N stand for? Is it any even number or all even numbers? Is it specific, particular, generic, or general? Perhaps it is not an even number at all, for it would never appear in a list of even numbers. Is it shorthand for {2N: N a whole number}? In this case, 2N is not an even number but an instruction to carry out a calculation. Mason and Pimm suggest that, for students, 2N sometimes represents any even number and that as a result they may</p><p>show that the sum of two even numbers is even by writing 2N + 2N = 4N. What is missing is awareness of 2N as a particular even number. Any has two interpretations: generic and general, and the latter implies "every." Recognizing that in fact "2N" is merely marks on the paper, they point out that the meaning has to do with perception. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Durkin and Shire (1991)</ref> suggest that some difficulties with language arise from ambiguities in the language itself, pointing in particular to polysemy, the property of some words to have distinct but related meanings. There are many examples, such as function or group, in which an everyday word takes on a specialized meaning in mathematics. Durkin and Shire suggest that the words some and any may be similarly confounded, providing additional insight into the observations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Mason and Pimm (1984)</ref> above. What is more problematic is when words take on multiple but related meanings within mathematical discourse itself. <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">Zazkis (1998)</ref> suggests, for example, that the term quotient takes on different meanings depending upon whether one is dealing with whole numbers or rational numbers. In abstract algebra, it appears that the term cycle is mathematically polysemous <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Lajoie &amp; Mura, 2000</ref>).</p><p>Taken together, these studies suggest that attaching names and notations to ideas involves subtle distinctions and ambiguities in language to fit with subtle conceptual distinctions among mathematical objects. Thus, empirical and theoretical work must allow for and explain the possibility that students might take words and notations to carry nonstandard meanings. For this study, the analytical tools were furnished by semiotics.</p></div>

This section presents the influential distinctions made by Saussure and Peirce on the nature of signs and of sign systems and their relationship to meaning. These basics of semiotics are then connected to the work of Vygotsky, with particular attention to learning and the relationship between personal and social meaning. Additional theoretical background is then provided on various types of signs and on the semiotics of mathematics.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Sign</head><p>Saussure's (1959) fundamental contribution was the distinction between the two inseparable components of the sign: the signifier (e.g., a sound or symbol) and the signified (the concept represented). The signifier itself is meaningless, for the same signifier can represent a different signified in a different context. Saussure also distinguished between speech (sound patterns) and writing, seeing writing as a separate, dependent sign system. Such a distinction was not necessary for this study, and Saussure himself arrived at many of his principles by analyzing words and not sound patterns. I do distinguish between mathematical language and notation, however, as there are clear psychological differences for mathematics students. The term multiplicative identity and the symbol 1, for example, do not necessarily have the same meaning.</p><p>The fundamental unit of semiotic analysis is the sign, which includes the signifier, the signified, and the crucial connection between them. The sign, it should be recognized, is arbitrary, in the sense that the bond between signifier and signified is essentially circumstantial, cultural, conventional, and historical. It is tempting to conclude that meaning is contained in the sign. But signs have no meaning except as they relate to and are distinguished from other signs:</p><p>In Saussurean linguistics, words do not refer to things themselves. Rather, they have meaning as points within the entire system that is a language-a system, further, conceived as a network of graded differences. ( <ref type="bibr">Harkness, 1983, p. 5)</ref> Thus, Saussure's "conception of meaning was purely structural and relational rather than referential" (Chandler, in press, emphasis in original). The structure of a language system or any system of signs depends upon its network of graded differences. The network is built from semantic distinctions that create concepts, for a concept is not a concept until its boundaries are specified. These semantic distinctions, as well as the supporting phonological, syntactic, and symbolic distinctions, are ontologically arbitrary, as evidenced by the fact that translation between languages is sometimes problematic.</p><p>Anthropological linguists Sapir and Whorf found, for example, that "Eskimo has many words for snow, whereas Aztec employs a single term for the concepts of snow, cold, and ice" <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1999</ref>). In other words, different languages provide for different concepts. This observation puts a twist on Shakespeare's aphorism "a rose by any other name would smell as sweet." The validity of the statement depends, after all, upon a language that distinguishes roses from objects that smell less sweet, and also distinguishes "smell" and "sweet" from related concepts.</p><p>Semiotics is concerned not only with what signs mean but with how signs mean what they mean <ref type="bibr">(Sturrock, cited in Chandler, in press</ref>), which requires studying the structural relations among signs, as mentioned above, and also the relationship between signs and interpreters. But what is meaning? And where is it? There is a long history of philosophical debate about the meaning of meaning (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Zemach, 1992)</ref>. For the purposes of this study, I point out one particularly influential approach, proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">Wittgenstein (1973)</ref>:</p><p>For a large class of cases-though not for all-in which we employ the word "meaning" it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language.</p><p>And the meaning of a name is sometimes explained by pointing to its bearer. (pt. 1, sct. 43)</p><p>Wittgenstein's solution contrasts sharply with that of Saussure (1959), for whom "the linguistic sign unites, not a thing and a name, but a concept and a sound-image"(p. 66).</p><p>For Saussure, meaning was a psychological phenomenon in that the signifier was a mental representation of sensory impressions and the signified was also a mental construct. Wittgenstein's statement, on the other hand, has a decidedly social or cultural sense, a point of view that fits with Matthews (2000), who argues that "meanings are in the public domain; they have to be enculturated" (p. 171). In the analysis for this study, I considered both psychological meaning and social meaning in mathematical discourse, focusing, in particular, on the relationships between them.</p><p>Charles Sanders Peirce developed a semiotic theory that takes into account both the psychological and social planes. Asserting that nothing is a sign unless it is interpreted as a sign, <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Peirce (1955)</ref> proposed, "A sign, or representamen, is something which stands to somebody for something in some respect or capacity" (p. 99). This is essentially a material version of Saussure's signifier. This sign addresses somebody, creating in the mind of that person an equivalent or more developed sign, which Peirce calls an interpretant. These are complemented by the object to which the sign refers, creating a triadic relationship. It is important to point out that there is not necessarily any direct relationship between the representamen and its object, and in fact the only relationship may be through an interpretant, which requires an interpreter.</p><p>The semiotic models of Saussure, Peirce, and Wittgenstein are compared in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>The vertical alignment is intended to indicate correspondences, though the correspondences, particularly between the psychological and social planes, are not direct.</p><p>Moreover, the fit among the models is not perfect, precisely because Saussure, Peirce, and Wittgenstein were using different categories as well as different names. In particular, an interpretant for Peirce could be either a mental recreation of the representamen or a more developed sign, perhaps approaching a concept.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> illustrates a semiotic model that blends each of the models described above and expands on them as well. A signifier is a symbol or a word or anything external that is taken to signify something else. A concept is a mental entity, which may be considered the core of a concept image, as described above. A referent is a mathematical object, process, or property, taken to be external in some sense. I make no ontological claims about whether or where the referent exists but say merely that it is useful in the analysis to suppose that it is distinct from the concept and from the signifier. This model of a sign, then, is what I mean by the meaning of a mathematical word or symbol, with the added stipulation that the meaning must be considered within a system of language and symbols. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptual Grids</head><p>In this study, signs provided access to the students' concept images. The students' use of signifiers provided insight about the meanings and understandings that the signs held in their thinking. The principles of semiotics make clear, however, that signs (and hence meanings) must be interpreted within a system of signs. Thus, the notion of concept image must be sufficiently flexible to pay attention to the ways that the students' concept images related to each other.</p><p>Within a system of signs, the meaning of an individual sign is determined, in large part, by its relations to other signs and, in particular, by the distinctions between it and closely related signs. The structure and categories of a system of signs lead those who use the signs to impose a conceptual grid on experience, specifying the way that the experience is cut up and hence shaping the way the experience is perceived. The crucial content in a system is the set of boundaries that are placed around and between the categories, and thus the essence of the system is independent of the particular symbols and names that are attached to the concepts it delineates. The categories, however, are not inherent in the experience but arise in the way the world is represented in the structure of the system. Different systems provide different categories that give rise to different concepts. Those differences manifest themselves in the particular grid that is used to organize an experience. A semiotician can gain insights about concepts and their meanings by paying attention to distinctions in the use of the signs-by trying to infer the conceptual grid.</p><p>Thus, language and other sign systems play a crucial role in shaping the concepts that are available. This position is supported by empirical work in linguistics:</p><p>The "real world" is to a large extent unconsciously built up on the language habits of the group. No two languages are ever sufficiently similar to be considered as representing the same social reality. The worlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds, not merely the same world with different labels attached. <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">(Sapir, 1929</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">(Sapir, /1949</ref> We cut nature up, organize it into concepts, and ascribe significances as we do, largely because we are parties to an agreement to organize it in this way-an agreement that holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns of our language. The agreement is, of course, an implicit and unstated one, BUT ITS TERMS ARE ABSOLUTELY OBLIGATORY; we cannot talk at all except by subscribing to the organization and classification of data which the agreement decrees. <ref type="bibr">(Whorf, 1956, pp. 213-214)</ref> The above theoretical perspectives led to what is known in linguistics as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which in its extreme form is called linguistic determinism, indicating that language determines the framework of perception and thought. Although few linguists accept the hypothesis in this form, its weaker formulation-that language influences thought-is generally accepted <ref type="bibr">(Chandler, in press</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Semiotics and Learning</head><p>As stated above, I consider in the analysis both psychological and social meaning, focusing particularly on the relationship between them. What is missing from all of the above treatments is acknowledgment that personal and social meanings may not fit.</p><p>Unless an individual makes the same conceptual distinctions as made by the community, the conceptual grids imposed on an experience will be different. In educational research, the critical question concerns the relationship between personal and social meanings during learning.</p><p>Much of Vygotsky's work can be viewed as describing the process of personal acquisition of social meanings, which is essentially the acquisition of speech and language. In developing his research methodology, Vygotsky <ref type="bibr">(1934/1986</ref>) was critical of methods of analysis that analyzed psychological processes into components, such as thought and word, to be studied separately, when what is most crucial is to understand how they operate together. In considering a method for analyzing the acquisition of language, he asked:</p><p>What is the unit of verbal thought that is further unanalyzable and yet retains the properties of the whole? We believe that such a unit can be found in the internal aspect of the word, in word meaning. (p. 5)</p><p>Although it seems that <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">Vygotsky (1978)</ref> did not explicitly draw on semiotics in his work, his perspective fits with semiotics. "The sign acts as an instrument of psychological activity" (p. 52), and by sign he generally meant a word, which is but one kind of signifier. By comparing the use of signs in thought to the use of tools in physical activity, he maintained that the sign and the tool both mediate activity indirectly, the tool being externally oriented and the sign being internally oriented.</p><p>Borrowing from French psychologist Paulhan, Vygotsky <ref type="bibr">(1934/1986)</ref> also proposed a distinction between the meaning and the sense of a word, which are roughly its denotation and connotation, respectively:</p><p>The sense of a word, according to <ref type="bibr">[Paulhan]</ref>, is the sum of all the psychological events aroused in our consciousness by the word. It is a dynamic, fluid, complex whole, which has several zones of unequal stability. Meaning is only one of the zones of sense, the most stable precise zone. (pp. <ref type="bibr">[244]</ref><ref type="bibr">[245]</ref> Note the striking similarity between this definition of sense and <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Tall and Vinner's (1981)</ref> definition of concept image as the total cognitive structure associated with a concept.</p><p>And so, the distinction between meaning and sense may be considered to be roughly the distinction between a concept and a concept image.</p><p>Constructing personal meaning requires establishing a conceptual bond between the signifier and the referent. This necessity is well recognized in mathematics education and is seen in the metaphor of attaching or gluing names to ideas (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Hewitt, 2001</ref>).</p><p>The fact that the signifier is arbitrary and thus needs to be taught <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Hewitt, 1999</ref>) fits well with many explicit and implicit theories of mathematics teaching and learning.</p><p>What is seldom recognized in mathematics education, however, is that the signified also is arbitrary, in the sense that the conceptual grid is not predetermined. In emphasizing the role of language in creating conceptual grids, Sapir and Whorf seem to have ignored the learning that is required to build the intended distinctions into one's own cognitive structure. I accept the weak version of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis in the sense that the conceptual grids that are used by the community certainly influence, and to a great extent limit and constrain, those of the learners. But one must also recognize that students' conceptual grids do not always fit with the ones used in the mathematical community.</p><p>Social and personal meanings will not match but will fit with some degree of viability.</p><p>Students do not learn social meanings whole and unproblematically but instead make successive approximations, adjusted via accommodation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Typology of Signs</head><p>In addition to his seminal contribution on the nature of the sign, Peirce (1955) also provided a detailed typology of signs. For the purposes of this study, it is sufficient to mention only his distinction between icon, index, and symbol. An icon bears a resemblance to its referent, "such as a lead pencil streak as representing a geometrical line" (p. 104). An index bears a direct connection to its referent, such as smoke to fire or, in mathematics, as a letter used in text following a figure to refer to a labeled portion of a figure. The label itself, however, is not an index. Finally, the connection between a symbol and its referent requires establishment by convention.</p><p>Bruner <ref type="bibr">(1966, pp. 10-11)</ref>  Regarding the signs (or representations) in abstract algebra, it is important to point out that Peirce categorized algebraic equations as icons, in the sense that they are compound signs, composed of symbols and indices, in which the relationship of the signs to one another iconically represents the mathematical expressions and relations they are to represent. But as Peirce pointed out, a sign is not a sign unless someone interprets it as such. Thus, whether a sign is an icon, index, or symbol depends upon the individual using or interpreting the sign. Therefore, when (but not until) an individual has established a conception of set, element, and set arithmetic in a group, the symbol aH can function as an icon for a coset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Semiotics of Mathematics</head><p>In a initial semiotic analysis of mathematics, Rotman (1988) identifies three aspects of mathematical discourse: the referential aspect, the formal aspect, and the psychological aspect, which have rough parallels in the mathematical philosophies of Platonism, formalism, and intuitionism, respectively. Each philosophy captures, in part, an important facet of what is felt to be intrinsic to mathematical activity. Certainly, in some undeniable but obscure way, mathematics seems at the same time to be a meaningless game, a subjective construction, and a source of objective truth. (p. 6) Thus, through semiotics, we are back to the metamathematical issues that arose in the discussion of definitions above.</p><p>Drawing on Peirce, Rotman distinguishes between the Mathematician (the "self"), who imagines and conducts reflective observations, the Agent (a skeleton diagram and surrogate of the self), who metaphorically constructs objects and carries out processes as demanded by the Mathematician, and the Person (the subject), who operates with the signs of natural language and participates in nonmathematical discourse. The distinctions become clear in <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Rotman's (1988)</ref> observation:</p><p>A mathematical assertion is a prediction, a foretelling of the result of performing certain actions upon signs. In making an assertion the Mathematician is claiming to know what would happen if the sign activities detailed in the assertion were to be carried out. (p. 13)</p><p>The Mathematician cannot directly verify claims that would require infinitely many operations, so she or he sets up a thought experiment in which it is the Agent who performs the necessary actions. The proof of the assertion is presented via the mathematical Code, which consists of "the discursive sum of all legitimately defined signs and rigorously formulated sign practices that are permitted to figure in mathematical texts" (p. 15). The proof is guided by an underlying idea, which Peirce called a leading principle. Discussion of neither the leading principle nor knowledge of the Agent are permitted in the Code. Rather, they are part of the metaCode, which consists of "informal, unrigorous locutions within natural language involved in talking about, referring to, and discussing the Code that mathematicians sanction" (p. 15). Thus, it is not the Mathematician alone but the Mathematician in the presence of the Person, the natural language subject of the metaCode, who can be persuaded by a proof, for conviction depends upon knowledge of both the leading principle and the actions of the Agent.</p><p>Rotman <ref type="bibr">(1988)</ref> then uses this model to provide compelling critiques of the three mathematical philosophies, largely based upon the aspects of mathematical experience that they ignore. I will not discuss the substance of these critiques except to mention the Platonic nature of naming. In present-day mathematical Platonism, the principal function of language is naming aspects of a pre-existing world-of assigning names to prelinguistic referents. Rotman argues instead that mathematical language creates reality.</p><p>Furthermore, what present-day mathematicians think they are doing-using mathematical language as a transparent medium for describing a world of pre-semiotic reality-is semiotically alienated from what they are, according to the present account, doing-namely, creating that reality through the very language which claims to "describe" it. (p. 30) Rotman's point here suggests that the preceding discussion of semiotics, particularly the Peircian version, suffers from what might be a serious philosophical problem: the ontological status of the mathematical object that serves as the referent in the model of the sign. In mathematical discourse, the various signifiers exist as marks on paper or perhaps merely as ephemeral vibrations in the air; the concepts exist in the minds of the students or in the collective mind of the mathematical community, as reflected in discourse. But in what sense does the object exist and, more particularly, where does it exist?</p><p>This is an age-old philosophical problem that was present in the work of Plato, Russell, Frege, Gödel, Hilbert, and many others. Rather than choosing among the various solutions to this problem, I suggest that for this study (and, I believe, for the semiotic study of mathematical cognition more generally) it was necessary only to suppose that mathematical objects exist in some sense. In particular, this assumption is all that is necessary for semiotics to be a useful analytical tool. From my understanding of philosophies of mathematics, this assumption and the general sign ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>) fit with all the major philosophies of mathematics, with the exception of Hilbert's strict formalism, which maintains that the symbols are themselves the mathematical objects. In particular, this approach can satisfy both Platonistic and anti-Platonistic philosophies (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Balaguer, 1998</ref>).</p><p>The point is mathematical cognition is primarily a psychological problem, not a philosophical problem, and, as such, theoretical explanations must be psychologically plausible. In other words, psychological considerations must trump philosophical ones.</p><p>Whether one supposes that mathematical objects exist in an abstract Platonic realm or exist only as fictions, whether abstract objects are created by the community or by an individual's thought, mathematical discourse-including all externalization of mathematical thought-proceeds as though abstract objects exist, and thus the analysis proceeded on this basis.</p><p>Unfortunately, this assumption is not sufficient to establish the psychological and philosophical grounding of my version of Peirce's semiotics. There is also the problem of whether the concept is distinct from the object. From a psychological perspective, it is clear that the concept and the object are not identical. A concept of a rock is certainly not identical to a rock that exists as an object in the world. Similarly, it is useful to consider that a concept of the group of integers is distinct from the object that is the set of integers under addition. If the object exists physically, then there is no question that a concept of the object is distinct from the object itself. Thus, once again, independent of where, how, or even whether mathematical objects exist, it was useful in the analysis to suppose that the concept and the object are distinct.</p><p>To complete this discussion, I must address the question of whether the signifier is distinct from the referent. In the case of a rock, there is no signifier; the rock is the object and Peirce's triadic structure fails. This is not surprising, however, for Peirce's semiotics is a theory of signs, not of physical objects. One approach, due to Hilbert, is to suppose that the symbols are the objects, simultaneously solving the ontological problem above and rendering the current question moot. Hilbert's solution to this problem strikes me as a desperate attempt to construct a coherent, anti-Platonic philosophy of mathematics.</p><p>The approach is both counterintuitive and anti-psychological, for it ignores the nature of mathematical activity and discourse. Mathematicians feel as though they are working with real objects that exist independent of the symbols and independent of their own thought, and mathematical discourse suggests such a perspective (see, e.g., P. J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Davis &amp; Hersh, 1981)</ref>.</p><p>Nonetheless, there is sometimes a sense in which students treat symbols as though they are the objects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Nemirovsky and Monk (2000)</ref> suggest the construct of fusion to describe how some children behave when symbols are used to model something in the world, such as marks on a page to represent people getting on and off a bus, or when a stick becomes a horse during a child's play. This construct is not immediately helpful for noncontextual mathematics, when there is neither a physical object nor a physical activity that the student is attempting to model with the symbols. In the case of a physical object or activity, the student is always able to step back and agree that the stick is not really the horse and the marks on the page are not really people on a bus. In the case of abstract mathematics, the phenomenon is more complex. Sfard (2000) points out that a crucial event in learning about a mathematical concept is when an individual separates a signifier from its referent. At first, the symbol (perhaps an operation table of a group) is the object of thought, much as a particular rock may be an object of thought. The students begins to develop a concept of the symbol by developing some familiarity with it, perhaps relating it to other symbols, transforming the symbol in various ways, and particularly translating it to what is to be another symbolic representation of the same object. Eventually, as the student begins to see the symbol not as a thing-in-itself but as a representation, then the student has a concept of an abstract object and the Peircian triadic sign applies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Semiotics in Mathematics Education</head><p>Because this version of semiotics and the semiotic framework below is not identical to anything currently available in the literature, it is important to point out some similarities and differences. I have already discussed ways in which this semiotics is similar to the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Sfard (2000)</ref> and others. Several other mathematics education researchers use <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Lacan's (1977)</ref> modifications of Saussure's version of semiotics to describe chains of signifiers that arise in mathematical discourse. <ref type="bibr">For example, Sfard (2000)</ref> suggests that "in Lacan's writings, one finds the idea of a sign turning into a signified of another sign" (p. 45). Proceeding in this way, one can create a hierarchy of signs of increasing abstraction. The literature describes how students use chains such as candies → unifix cubes → pictured collections → verbal enumerations <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Cobb, Gravemeijer, Yackel, McClain, &amp; Whitenack, 1997</ref>) and double-decker bus passengers → beads → nonstandard notations → conventional notations <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Gravemeijer, Cobb, Bowers, &amp; Whitenack, 2000</ref>). Such chains of signifiers typically proceed from some real-world situation to be modeled, to abbreviated (iconic or essentially indexical) signifiers, to conventional symbols. The trouble with this description is that any chain of signifiers creates a hierarchy that implicitly privileges some signifiers over others. In studying advanced mathematics, where what is important is moving flexibly among the various important signifiers, including names, definitions, and several symbolic representations, one needs a framework that allows more flexibility. The Peircian approach is preferable because it allows consideration of the concept and the object separately, as discussed above, and because it allows a nonhierarchical perspective on the various signs that might come into play during mathematical discourse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical Framework</head><p>The goal of the study was to characterize students' images for concepts in elementary group theory. The preceding sections have described a number of theoretical constructs that inform the characterizations. In particular, I have discussed the role of definitions in mathematics, the role of metaphor in mathematical intuition, the distinction between processes and objects in mathematical thinking, the distinction between abstraction and generalization in the creation of mathematical concepts, and the role of naming and notation in mathematical thinking and communication. The primary analytical tool, borrowed from semiotics, is the sign, embodied as the distinction between a signifier, a concept, and a referent.</p><p>In this section I describe how these theoretical constructs and analytical tools are brought together in an analytical framework. For the purposes of this study, I was interested in the relationship between a concept and three types of signs: symbols, names, and definitions, including informal ones. That symbols and names are signs is obvious; that definitions are signs follows from the substitution criterion described above. A primary activity of thought is replacing one representation with another, and substitution of a definition for the defined accomplishes exactly that.</p><p>The theoretical constructs discussed above are partially synthesized in the semiotic conceptual framework shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref> for a conceptual object. It is important to note the framework is but a mere skeleton intended to highlight the main relationships for this analysis. The two front-most faces of this pyramid and the vertical cross-section through the vertices labeled concept, name, and referent each constitute a sign in the Peircian sense, in that they are triadic relationships between a concept, a signifier (a name, symbol, or definition), and a referent. Furthermore, the framework suggests consideration of mediating role (in Vygotsky's sense) of the name, symbol, or definition in mathematical activity. The framework in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref> is not a concept image but rather an organized collection of slices of the concept image that serves as a tool for semiotic analysis. Separating these various signifiers from the referent and from each other provides lenses for looking at students' use of language and notation for the purpose of making inferences about the conceptual structures that the language and notation represents. By paying attention to structural relations among signifiers, one can gain insights on structural relations among concepts.</p><p>As for the concepts themselves, they are likely to be metaphorical in nature, and semiotic analysis can serve to reveal some of the operative metaphors. As for the referents, they may be objects, processes, properties, or some combination of these, though in view of the process/object duality of many mathematical concepts, perhaps the nature of the referent is in the relationship between the concept and the referent. Taken as a whole, this framework for analysis can be seen as an elaboration of <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Gray and Tall's (1994)</ref> notion of procept, where the semiotic nature of the analysis is made explicit.</p><p>Furthermore, the analysis takes advantage of the observation that it is possible to ascertain whether students have constructed a mental object based on the way they talk and write about the concept ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">Tall et al., 2000</ref>).</p><p>The above framework serves to guide the analysis of individual concepts. But what about collections of concepts and the relationships among them? Here I use the metaphor of a conceptual grid that organizes experience into concepts. The grid is not in an individual's cognitive structure but rather is created because of one's cognitive structure and is then imposed on experience. In other words, a conceptual grid is not something one has but rather something one uses. There is a potential conflict, it should be pointed out, between the notion of concept image, which assumes the concepts to be primary, and the metaphor of a conceptual grid that manifests itself in the way experience is cut up and organized into concepts. Thus, one needs a sufficiently flexible notion of concept image to accommodate not only the possibility that students might have the right concepts but attach the wrong names but also the possibility of having entirely different concepts. In general, this accommodation requires an analysis that gets at the concept without the name (via an activity) and also analysis that tries to determine what is organized under that name. Furthermore, the analysis must provide for the possibility of multiple meanings in the language itself (polysemy or lexical ambiguity) and the analogous phenomenon of compartmentalization in thought, wherein an individual holds two aspects of the same concept under the same name in such a way that they are not evoked at the same time and therefore do not interact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>On the fundamental assumption that mathematical learning is meaningful learning, the ideas expressed in this chapter combine to create a conceptual and analytical framework intended to support the investigation of the meaning behind students' utterances. The notion of a concept image, as distinct from a concept definition, served to organize the analysis of learning and using the various concepts in elementary group theory. To characterize the students' concept images, I paid attention to issues of abstraction and generalization, to the sense in which they treated the concepts as processes or objects, and to the metaphors they used explicitly or implicitly. To study the students' use of language and notation, I borrowed constructs from semiotics, focusing in particular on the sign as a relationship among a signifier, a concept, and a referent, such as a mathematical object.</p><p>The conceptual perspective evolved over the course of the study. Early versions helped to frame the initial research questions, to inform the design and implementation of the course, and to ground the research methodology and data collection. Later versions served to guide the analysis of the data. These contextual aspects of the study and the evolution of the research questions and methodology are elaborated in the next chapter.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONTEXT AND METHODOLOGY</head><p>The participants in this study were enrolled in a junior-level abstract algebra course at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) during the spring term of 1996. The class was taught by Dr. Steve Benson, a visiting faculty member, and I served as his teaching assistant. The curriculum was designed collaboratively by Dr. Benson and me. The instruction was unusual in that there were no formal lectures, although there were whole- class discussions at least weekly that were led by Dr. Benson or me.</p><p>This setting was chosen for the study based, in part, on my theoretical stance and my research questions. They might be paraphrased as, What does students' understanding look like in abstract algebra, and how does it build on their prior experience? Because this was essentially an exploratory study, I wanted to be able to observe some of this knowledge building in a rich, example-driven environment in which the students were encouraged to make their thinking overt and explicit.</p><p>The analysis and results are based largely on interviews with five key participants. The methods of analysis were designed to provide characterizations of the students' concept images. This chapter describes the context, curriculum, and instruction in more detail, followed by descriptions of the participants, the data sources, and the methods of analysis.</p></div>

The course was offered in only one section in the spring term of 1996.</p><p>The class met for 50 minutes, four times per week, for 15 weeks. (See Appendix A for a syllabus.) There were two midterm exams, the first consisting of an in-class and a take- home portion and the second entirely take-home, and a two-hour final exam (see Appendix B). A standard text <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Gallian, 1994)</ref> was used as a resource for examples, problems, and explanations. The bulk of the class was devoted to collaborative problem sets (classwork) and individual assignments (homework), written by Dr. Benson and me, with Dr. Benson taking the lead role. Problem sets with homework assignments were distributed (sometimes separately) approximately every week, though more frequently at the beginning of the course (see Appendix C). Some of the classwork was completed using the computer software Exploring Small Groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Geissinger, 1989)</ref>, which was available in the department's computer laboratory. The classwork and homework were periodically collected for comment or grading. Although I provided comments on the students' work, I had no responsibility for grading.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mathematical Content</head><p>This course focused on group theory, including the concepts of group, subgroup, isomorphism, homomorphism, coset, and quotient group. This focus is in contrast to some beginning abstract algebra courses that include introduction to rings and fields. To provide an experiential basis for the group axioms, these concepts were preceded by some exploratory work in number theory, particularly modular arithmetic. The course was highly example driven, focusing especially on the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Z:</formula><p>The group of integers. The elements are the integers, {… , -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, …}, and the operation is addition. Sometimes the operation of multiplication was also considered to illustrate the failure of the inverse axiom.</p><p>nZ: The group of multiples of n. The elements are the integers, {… , -2n, -n, 0, n, 2n, …}, and the operation is addition.</p><p>Z n : the group of integers modulo n. The elements are the integers {0, 1, … , n - 1} and the operation is addition modulo n. Sometimes multiplication modulo n was also considered to illustrate the failure of the inverse axiom.</p><p>U n : the group of units modulo n. The elements are the integers in {0, 1, … , n - 1} that have inverses under the operation multiplication modulo n. An equivalent characterization is the integers in {1, … , n -1} that are relatively prime (i.e., share no factors) with n. Thus, for example, U 10 = {1, 3, 7, 9}.</p><p>D n : the dihedral group of order 2n. The elements are the symmetries of a regular n-gon and the operation is given by thinking of the symmetries as transformations and composing them; that is, carrying out one transformation followed by the other. The elements of D n were represented both geometrically (as transformations) and as permutations of the vertices.</p><p>S n : The symmetric group of degree n. The elements are the permutations of a set with n elements, and the operation is composition of permutations, thought of as functions. The elements were usually represented as arrays notation or in cycle notation. For example, a permutation α, where α(1) = 3, α(2) = 2, α(3) = 4, α(4) = 1, is represented by the array</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">      1 4 2 3 4 3 2 1</formula><p>where the elements in the second row indicate the images of the elements in the first row. In cycle notation, this same permutation would be written (134), indicating that 1 goes to 3, which goes to 4, which goes (back) to 1. The fact that 2 is missing implies that 2 remains unchanged. The identity permutation is denoted (1) in cycle notation, specifying explicitly that 1 goes to 1 and implying that everything else remains unchanged as well.</p><p>We also considered the real, rational, and complex numbers; sets of matrices; and various groups and nongroups given by operation tables. During class and on problem sets, these examples were notated as sets, leaving the operation implicit (see chapter 5).</p><p>These examples were used to motivate the concepts treated in the course, which included group, subgroup, isomorphism, center, centralizer, order of an element, cyclic subgroups, subgroups generated by elements, homomorphism, coset, Lagrange's theorem, and quotient groups. These concepts are described in more detail in the description of the problem sets below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instruction</head><p>As was stated above, this class included no lectures. Most of the time for this class, both in class and out, was devoted to working on activities and problem sets designed by Dr.</p><p>Benson and me. The students worked through most of the activities and problem sets collaboratively, usually in groups of three or four, although some assignments, particularly the take-home exams, were to be completed individually. During class time, Dr. Benson and I worked with the groups and periodically brought the whole class together to discuss common issues, to encourage synthesis of the various results, and to point toward important themes and ideas. Both individually and when working collaboratively, the students were expected to justify their claims. In this way, student thinking was expected to be overt and explicit. Both Dr. Benson and I held office hours, both regularly and as needed, and students attended both individually and in groups, usually to get help with specific problems on the problem sets.</p><p>Aspects of the theoretical perspective described in chapter 3 implicitly and explicitly informed the instruction and the design and implementation of the problem sets. In particular, Dr. Benson and I tried to pay particular attention to what the students were thinking because what they learned might not be what we intended. The class was somewhat like a teaching experiment in that our planning tried to take into account the experiences, including both difficulties and insights, that students were having with previous problem sets. Moreover, because reflection is key to building strong and productive understandings, we encouraged overt reflective activity whenever possible, meaning that the students were expected to explain their thinking, orally or in writing, to us or to other students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Problem Sets and Homework</head><p>The problem sets were designed to provide experience with examples that could be used to motivate the key ideas. Often, concepts were introduced not by a definition, statement, or theorem, but by a problem. Then, as students developed solutions, key features or properties of the problem were drawn out, defined, and given standard names and notations. Often the key terms, definitions, and notations were provided again in subsequent problem sets. In this way, the students might see some of the concepts as growing naturally from the problems they were trying to solve. A sampling of the problem sets is included in Appendix C.</p><p>The course initially focused on modular arithmetic, which was used the primary example of a system in which to solve equations. For example, the students were asked to find solutions of 3 + x = 5 mod 7, 3x = 5 mod 7, and 3x = 5 mod 6, and to investigate when such equations had a unique solution, no solutions, or multiple solutions. The students also spent time solving equations of the form ax = b, a + x = b, or a*x = b in other mathematical systems such as subsets of the real numbers, sets of matrices, and also in finite systems for which the operation was given by an operation table. The group axioms were then presented as a generalized consolidation of what the students suggested needed to be true about a system in order for such equations always to be solvable.</p><p>The students were asked to find all possible Cayley tables with 2, 3, and 4 elements in order to motivate the ideas of isomorphic groups, which they initially called congruent groups. The isomorphism itself was not explicitly a function, at first, but instead resulted from a renaming process based on looking at the group table.</p><p>In order to provide experience for making sense of addition and multiplication of cosets, set addition (and multiplication) were introduced early through examples such as {1, 3, 4} + {2, 6} = {3, 7, 5, 9, 6, 10} and by comparing the sets 3Z, 3Z + 1, … , 3Z + 7.</p><p>Later, the students were asked to make operation tables for {0, 4, 8}, {1, 5, 9}, {2, 6, 10}, and {3, 7, 11} in Z 12 . And to motivate the usefulness of the normality of a subgroup after introducing the concept of coset, the students performed coset arithmetic at first without concern for whether the subgroup was normal. Additional detail is provided in chapter 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>All 29 students enrolled in the class were participants in the study for the purposes of field observation. All were mathematics majors: 24 of them were juniors, and 22 were pursing a Bachelor of Science in one or more of the Mathematics Education options.</p><p>This high concentration of mathematics education majors is typical in the spring semester offering of this course. They had previously taken an average of seven mathematics classes, typically including a four-course calculus sequence, courses in mathematical proof and statistics, and another course such as geometry or linear algebra. Because the mathematical proof course is a prerequisite for abstract algebra, it is reasonable to assume that all students had taken it previously, although two did not list it on the questionnaire distributed on the first day of class. Of the 29 participants, 25 allowed collection of their written work, 21 were willing to be interviewed, and 19 consented to both. Blank consent forms and Institutional Review Board Approval are provided in Appendix D.</p><p>Almost all of the students who completed course evaluations said they found the problem sets and the collaboration helpful in their learning. Some students even said they found the take-home exams particularly helpful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key Participants</head><p>For key participants, I wanted students who might be considered typical students in the course. I did not want students who were struggling so much that the interviews would not be able to reveal their understanding of the key ideas in the course. On the other hand, I did not want students for whom many of the abstractions and generalizations were quick and obvious. Thus, based on discussions with and observations of the students over the first two weeks of the course, I chose six students who had given permission for full participation and whom I expected to perform at an average level in the class. As it turned out, their grades were above average, with 3 A, 2 A-, and 1 B in the following distribution: 13 A, 4 A-, 9 B, 2 B-, and 1 D. The study was based primarily on an analysis of the interviews with the five students for whom I was able to collect a full set of interviews: Carla, Diane, Lori, Robert, and Wendy. 9 These students are described briefly below.</p><p>The data for these sketches come from three sources: questionnaires distributed to all the students at the beginning of the course, moments in the interviews when the students chose to describe themselves, and conversations with the students after the completion of the class.</p><p>Carla. Carla was a junior and was majoring in mathematics education in both the middle and secondary school options. She planned to teach eighth grade. She had taken seven college mathematics courses previously, including calculus, and was taking linear algebra concurrently. Two of these courses were among those taken primarily by preservice elementary teachers.</p><p>Carla described herself as follows: "I am a visual learner. So I remember, like, a sequence of letters if I see them" (Interview 1, line 34). She said she was a very successful mathematics student, though she admitted mathematics had not always been easy for her. When a mathematics course was very challenging, she often looked back later and appreciated the struggle. Looking back on this abstract algebra class, she indicated that the class had been stressful and she did not like the fact that that Dr. Lori. Lori was a junior pursuing a BA in mathematics and not intending to teach. She was repeating the course. She had been advised to take abstract algebra in the fall because of a perception that the sections offered in the fall were typically geared more toward the mathematics majors and those in the spring were geared more toward the mathematics education majors. Because she had received a poor grade in the fall, she was taking the course again in order to improve the grade on her transcript. She had taken five other mathematics courses previously.</p><p>Lori was the weakest student among the key participants. She was the only one who received a B in the class; all of the others received an A or an A-. She indicated that she appreciated some aspects of the approach of this class: "I don't think that I necessarily understood the concept of closed until we made charts and tables and stuff, and we never made tables last semester" (Interview 1, line 5).</p><p>Robert. Robert was a junior and a mathematics education major under the secondary school option. He had taken five mathematics classes previously, including calculus. He intended to teach high school mathematics and was considering a graduate degree in science education.</p><p>Robert claimed on his questionnaire that he had had uneven success in his mathematics classes: "I find that I do all right w/ computational math, but I find the theory classes very difficult. Perhaps due to my lack of intuition." When struggling with an unfamiliar problem or concept, he said that he often look at various texts, examples, definitions, to "see if I could make heads or tails out of it, which, typically, I probably couldn't. It's written in mathematics, not English" (Interview 1, line 162).</p><p>Wendy. Wendy was a senior and was majoring in mathematics education in the elementary and middle school option. During her program she had decided that she would prefer to teach secondary school, so she was planning to attend graduate school for secondary certification after graduation. She had taken thirteen mathematics courses previously, including calculus. Three of the courses were among those typically taken by preservice elementary teachers.</p><p>After the class was over, Wendy indicated that her favorite part about the class was all the writing. She explained that she got a lot out of doing the problems and said she got even more out of explaining the problem and trying to write her solution carefully.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instructor</head><p>Dr. Steve Benson is a mathematician who was a visiting faculty member at UNH and who, at the time, had recently decided to devote his attention to mathematics education.</p><p>He received his doctorate from the University of Illinois in 1988 and then held a two-year postdoctoral teaching position at St. Olaf College. He taught at Santa Clara University and another year at St. Olaf before coming to UNH in the fall of 1995. His research area was algebraic number theory. While working in mathematics, he published two research papers, two expository papers in journals of the Mathematical Association of America, and one paper on teaching suggestions in abstract algebra <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Benson &amp; Richey, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Dr. Benson had a temporary faculty appointment in the mathematics department at UNH, which he saw as an opportunity to learn about and begin working in mathematics education by interacting with the faculty and graduate students in the Ph.D. program. His teaching was always a priority in his work, as evidenced by a graduate student teaching award at the University of Illinois and by consistently excellent teaching evaluations. In fact, teaching was a primary reason that he pursued and accepted the postdoctoral position at St. Olaf College, which is known for valuing and encouraging quality teaching. He had taught the content of this abstract algebra course three times before, although previously his approach had been more traditional.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Teacher/Researcher</head><p>In my interactions with students, I played two roles-teacher and researcher-which brought both opportunities and pitfalls. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ball (2000)</ref> suggests that such an approach "offers the researcher a role in creating the phenomenon to be investigated coupled with the capacity to examine it from the inside, to learn that which is less visible" (p. 388).</p><p>Simultaneously, the dual roles create challenges with respect to the validity and generalizability of the results, and particularly with respect to causation. Here I pause to discuss how I managed and coordinated these roles.</p><p>By assuming the roles of both teacher and researcher in this study, I gained considerable inside knowledge. In constructing the problem sets, I provided some of the ideas and served as a sounding board for some of Dr. Benson's ideas. Like Dr. Benson, I helped and guided groups of students as they worked in class on their problem sets. I led some of the whole-class discussions, and I provided office hours in which students sought extra help. In this way, I provided another pair of ears and eyes to help Dr. Benson learn about the students and their thinking. These duties not only provided detailed knowledge of the context for the interviews but also helped me get to know all the students much better than if I had merely observed from the back of the class and selected a few for interviews.</p><p>In class as well as in office hours, the students' thinking was expected to be explicit and was valued, no matter how nascent. Dr. Benson and I rarely told students that they were right or wrong, an approach that served to encourage their own thinking and discussion, although, in retrospect, our implementation of this approach may have been too extreme, as it occasionally led to unproductive discussions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Chazan &amp; Ball, 1999</ref>). It is plausible that the atmosphere we had created in the classroom was partially responsible for the fact that key participants often required little prompting in the interviews.</p><p>Many of the pitfalls of being a teacher/researcher arise when the purpose of the research is to study teaching. The problem is gaining sufficient objectivity to ensure the reliability of observations and the validity of conclusions about one's own thoughts and actions.</p><p>Such pitfalls were not present in this study, however, because the purpose was to study learning.</p><p>Some of the challenges arise in any research that relies on cases. In such research, generalizations must be made carefully and are often only tentative. Any generalization depends upon the extent to which the case resembles other situations. Yet generalizability depends also upon the nature of the claim. When the goal is to establish an existence proof or theory building, as was the case for this study, generalizability is determined outside and after the study and thus is not really an issue.</p><p>The most potentially problematic issue for a study such as this is the evaluative role of the teacher. Ball hints at the issue when asking, "What might [the students] not want to say to her? What might it be risky to disclose?" (p. 389). Although it is plausible that this issue is not serious when the students are third graders, as in Ball's research, I am quite convinced that it merits careful consideration when the students are undergraduates. This is why I chose to make it clear to the students, with Dr. Benson's support and assistance, that I was to play no direct evaluative role in the class. I was particularly fortunate that Dr. Benson was comfortable with this arrangement.</p><p>The goal of this study was to describe student thinking and, to the extent possible, to build theoretical explanations for the descriptions without necessarily attributing cause as part of the explanations. With such goals, validity and reliability are ensured during analysis through the constant comparative method, as described under methods of analysis. In summary, the conduct of the study and the methods of analysis were designed to take advantage of the opportunities and mitigate the pitfalls of my dual role as teacher/researcher.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Sources</head><p>The primary source of data was the interviews with five key participants. Some exams and other written work were also collected, including final exam and second midterm papers from all the students, to provide a broader view of the ways students understood the material. Contextual data were provided through a questionnaire distributed on the first day of class (see Appendix A), from field notes I took on 20 occasions, from the problem sets and explanatory handouts, and from audiotaped planning discussions with Dr. Benson.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Interviews</head><p>The interviews took place outside of class, and the students were compensated for their time. All interviews were simultaneously videotaped and audiotaped to aid subsequent transcription and analysis. Each of the five key participants took part in four interviews organized roughly around mathematical content, as described below. To provide some perspective on how the students were working together in the collaborative setting, Lori and Diane were usually interviewed together. (Their third interviews occurred separately because of scheduling difficulties.) Thus, a total of 17 interviews provided the core of the data. The interview schedule is given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>. Two of the interviews took place after the final exam, which was administered on May 10, 1996.</p><p>The interviews were intended to address the initial versions of my research questions, which all fit under the guiding question, "In what ways do these students understand the mathematical content of the course?" The interviews were not highly structured but rather were exploratory and contingent. To provide sufficient data on each of the key concepts in the course, the four interviews were organized around mathematical content:</p><p>(1) groups and subgroups, (2) isomorphisms, (3) homomorphisms and cosets, and (4) quotient groups. Each interview typically began with a common question and proceeded from there, guided by the student's responses. The interviews were opportunities for me to observe the issues that the students were struggling with during their early learning of these new concepts. Thus, most of the interviews were conducted during the several days after which key concepts had been introduced, sometimes immediately following the class. My aim was to try to understand students' utterances as sensible and meaningful from their individual perspectives.</p><p>During all my discussions with students (during interviews, office hours, and class), my predominant method was to pose problems, ask questions, and encourage students to explain their thinking, so the students were accustomed to nondirective interaction.</p><p>During the interviews, however, because I was trying to understand students' understanding, I was typically more probing and less directive than in class or in office hours, at least until I thought I understood what a student was saying. Then, when I did move on, I typically posed a leading question intended to provide opportunities for the student to correct errors or make new connections among new and old ideas.</p><p>The interview tasks and questions were essentially of three varieties: tasks from the literature, open-ended questions such as "What is a homomorphism?" intended to get at the meaning the student had developed, and questions intended to probe the key concepts through standard examples. The key questions and topics in the interviews are given below. "What is a homomorphism?" and I asked for examples. Then, I gave the students a homomorphism from U 8 to Z 4 and asked how they would check whether it was a homomorphism. After checking a few specific examples, I asked them to find the kernel of the homomorphism and the cosets of the kernel. I asked Robert also to find the cosets of the subgroup generated by 3 in Z 12 . I asked Wendy to try to make a group out of the cosets.</p><p>Interview 4: Cosets and quotient groups. The fourth interview was based on comparing the cosets of the subgroup generated by <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(12)</ref> in D 3 with the subgroup generated by (123).</p><p>The students computed right and left cosets and then tried to construct a group using the cosets. Wendy also computed cosets and the quotient of 4Z in Z, and Carla also constructed the cosets and quotient of {0, 3, 6, 9} in Z 12 . Much of each interview was spent sorting out the students' uses of the terms coset, normal, and quotient group to describe the results of their calculations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conventions in Transcripts and Figures</head><p>All the interviews were transcribed. In the transcripts, I tried to capture all abandoned phrases and restatements, although "ahs" and "ums" were mostly ignored. Because I wanted the analysis to be guided as much as possible by complete thoughts, I chose the paragraph as the smallest unit of coding, although I refer to these paragraphs as "lines" in the transcripts and provide line numbers for all direct quotes. In order to improve the coherence and completeness of paragraphs in the transcripts, I did not interrupt a statement from one speaker to insert inconsequential statements such as "Okay" from another speaker when the statement seemed to have no effect on the train of thought.</p><p>Instead, I inserted such statements inside the paragraph of the primary speaker, enclosing the statements in square brackets to signal the change of speaker.</p><p>Numbers were written as numerals in the transcripts except when the use of the numbers did not seem relevant to the mathematics. In long lists of numbers, semicolons were used to indicate slight pauses. The notations ×, +, -, and = were used only for the words times, plus, negative, and equals, respectively; similar expressions such as "added to" or "is equal to" were written out as words. Notations for standard groups were used throughout the transcripts, so that "Zee six" was transcribed as "Z 6 ," for example. Functional notation was used when the argument of the function seemed clear, so that, for example, "f of x" was transcribed as f(x). Set notation was used when the context or the written work suggested, either explicitly or implicitly, that the students were thinking about sets.</p><p>Similar conventions were used for permutation notation, transcribing "one two three" as "(123)," for example. These transcriptional conventions helped me read and analyze the data more fluently than if I had written out each word in full. Importantly, each of these conventions is reversible by reading the transcript aloud. The students' written work was typeset as figures rather than scanned, on the judgment that the essential characteristics of that work could be more clearly conveyed this way. Thus, it is my conviction that these conventions improved the clarity of the transcripts and the written work without influencing the data or analysis by imposing notation inappropriately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods of Analysis</head><p>Essentially three types of analysis were employed: detailed analysis of each interview transcript; global analysis to confirm, refine, and refute the initial hypotheses generated by the detailed analysis; and conceptual analysis of the mathematical content. Because both the research questions and the methods of analysis evolved as the study progressed, I begin this section with discussion of the fits and false starts that led to the methods.</p><p>Then I provide a detailed description of the methods and the ways that each type of analysis informed the others. I close with a discussion of the relationship between the methodology of this study and the methodology of constant comparison and grounded theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evolution of the Method</head><p>In my proposal for this study, the research questions included the following: "In what ways do these students understand the mathematical content of the course? How do these understandings emerge from their experiences?" These broad questions were sufficient to guide the interviews, but, as will become clear, they were initially unhelpful in guiding the analysis because they neither suggested a scheme for coding nor helped me decide what to look for in the transcripts.</p><p>Before coding any of the data, I developed a preliminary coding scheme that included categories of mathematical content, such as coset and commutativity; categories from the research literature, such as the proof schemes of <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Harel and Sowder (1998)</ref>; categories of student action, such as choosing an example or giving a justification; categories about affect, metacognition, and the nature of mathematics; and categories that described the types of errors that students made, along with categories that described how errors were resolved. The scheme was, from my perspective, exhaustive (and exhausting), including all possible dimensions and aspects of mathematical experience that I could imagine might be present in the interviews. My attempts to use this scheme to code the transcripts statement by statement proved unsuccessful not only because the scheme was unwieldy but also because the salient portions of a transcript were typically extended exchanges that fell entirely under one or two codes. Simultaneously, other exchanges were straightforward calculations that were not particularly interesting. The fact that both kinds of exchanges received equal emphasis in the coding was clearly not satisfactory.</p><p>Furthermore, large portions of the scheme did not seem pertinent to the available data.</p><p>I temporarily abandoned coding and instead carried out a detailed analysis of each transcript. By comparing the audiotape with the student's written work and, when necessary, with the videotape, each transcript was annotated to clarify the referents of pronouns and what the student was writing. At the same time, the transcripts were segmented into episodes, providing both a chronology and a table of contents for each interview. Additional annotations were inserted to highlight episodes, events, and statements that struck me as interesting or significant, typically because of the use of nonstandard language, an error that seemed nontrivial, a hint of an unusual way of thinking, or a change that suggested learning. Guided by very general questions such as "What was the student doing? What was the student using?" I developed short descriptions of these interesting events. The table of contents and the significant events, together with my description, provided an initial "bottom-up" analysis that also served as a summary of the interview.</p><p>During the above processes, the research questions evolved, eventually arriving at questions such as, "What concept images do students demonstrate as they are learning the fundamental ideas of group, subgroup, and isomorphism?" Using the summaries of the interviews, I began the next phase of analysis with an eye toward answering the research questions. Intending to delineate various components of concept images, I developed a coding scheme that was short, focused on describing concept images, and more relevant to the data. The scheme had categories such as representations, properties, and examples of concepts, as well as definitions, results, and associations about concepts. Once again, however, when I tried to code the transcripts, I had trouble making the scheme fit. It became clear that the most salient features of the interviews were issues of language, notation, and meaning, and the relationship between signs and the concepts that they were intended to represent. These issues still were not sufficiently prominent in the coding scheme.</p><p>I again abandoned explicit coding. Reviewing the interview summaries, I instead asked directed questions such as "What can I say about this student and her concept of group?"</p><p>that led to answers such as the following: "She reasoned from the table; she confused related words; she used idiosyncratic language and syntax; she was confused about the operation in Z n ." The resulting long list of observations about student thinking was then examined for emergent themes. In continuing the episode-by-episode analysis and synthesis, I elaborated the observations with examples of dialogue from the interviews, regularly asking myself, "What is this an example of?" thereby keeping the goal of describing student understanding at the forefront of my thought. As is described in detail below, I also looked for regularities and overarching themes that could be developed into theoretical explanations.</p><p>In summary, the method of analysis evolved from line-by-line coding to detailed description of significant episodes and events. Another way to describe the transition is as follows: The unit of analysis was originally the concept, as indexed (not in the Peircian sense) by the concept name. The students' language use was so unusual and idiosyncratic, however, that it became clear that the unit of analysis needed to be the episode. This change is analogous to <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">Wertsch's (1985)</ref> observation that although</p><p>Vygotsky began with the word as his unit of analysis, many of his colleagues and students (e.g., Davidov, Leont'ev) moved to using the activity as the unit of analysis (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">Wertsch, 1981)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Detailed Description of the Method</head><p>The goal of the analysis was, of course, to provide answer to the research questions, which meant describing students' concept images for the key concepts in the course and also describing the ways that preliminary mathematical ideas came into play. In the analysis, I considered both personal and conventional meanings of the concepts and focused on the differences between them, for that is where clues to learning problems lie.</p><p>Thus, the main fodder for the descriptions of students' concept images was episodes, events, and statements that struck me as significant because of potential differences between personal and conventional meanings. Events were pursued through detailed analysis when my observations about the event seemed sufficiently robust, such as when similar events occurred elsewhere with the same student or with a different student. In this section, I describe some technical and theoretical aspects of the method and also provide additional detail.</p><p>Most of the data were managed via N5, the fifth major revision of NUD*IST qualitative research software <ref type="bibr">(QSR International, 2000</ref>). The annotated transcripts and their summaries were imported into N5 along with excerpts from the midterm and final exams of the five key participants. To provide some context for the interviews and exams, the discussions with Dr. Benson were summarized, including some verbatim transcription, and imported into N5. The field notes were also imported. All electronically available data were coded for mathematical content. In particular, I coded for the following concepts: modular arithmetic; function; binary operation; properties of operations, including the four group axioms and commutativity; group; subgroup; isomorphism;</p><p>homomorphism; kernel; coset; normality; and quotient group. These mathematical categories formed the primary headings under which I sought to describe students' concept images.</p><p>In trying to create descriptions of students' concept images, I found that one of the most puzzling aspects was explaining or even describing students' idiosyncratic and seemingly inconsistent use of language and notation. I was initially at a loss and for a long time found little in the mathematics education literature that helped me understand the students' statements and actions. Eventually, I was led to literature in linguistics, philosophy, and particularly semiotics, from which I borrowed and adapted theoretical constructs that helped explain what I saw and that led to a theory that ultimately connected back to the mathematics education literature.</p><p>With these additional theoretical constructs, the analysis of the episodes became essentially semiotic in character. Although semiotics holds no widely shared theoretical assumptions or methodologies, a consistent feature is looking beyond specific signs to discern the relationships between signs and the systems of distinctions operating within them (Chandler, in press). For analyzing student thinking, the approach might be described as looking at the students' language rather than through it <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">(Sfard, 2000</ref>).</p><p>Lacking direct access to the personal meanings of the students, I relied on semiotic analysis to help me make inferences about those meanings and to build a theory that fit the data. In the detailed analysis of the significant episodes, I tried to discern meaning in students' utterances and tried to understand their use of mathematical signs, particularly words, notations, and definitions, using the analytical framework described in chapter 3.</p><p>Not all significant episodes were so analyzed; instead, I focused on those episodes that either spoke to the use of language, notation, and representations; suggested consideration of relevant objects, processes, or metaphors; or raised issues of abstraction and generalization.</p><p>To complement the detailed analyses of episodes, I also took a global view, searching for additional uses of words or notation that might confirm, refine, or refute the working hypotheses. For example, I coded and collected the various formal and informal definitions that the students gave of the key concepts in the course. Some of these were in response to very direct prompts such as "What is a homomorphism?" as in the interviews, or "Provide complete definitions for the following terms and phrases" as on the final exam (Appendix B). Other definitions arose without a direct prompt, typically as part of an explanation of something else.</p><p>In the global analysis, I used N5 to search the transcripts and other electronically available data for other instances of the signs (i.e., words and notations) that the students and I were using to discuss the particular concept. On the basis of my familiarity with the data and with the aid of the interview outlines, I also carefully examined portions of the transcripts that were likely to speak to the particular ideas under analysis. The excerpts identified by these searches were considered first for relevance and then for fit with the emerging hypotheses, which were modified to accommodate data that did not fit.</p><p>Because the study aimed to characterize students' concept images, the hypotheses were often about a nonstandard conception that a student had during a particular episode.</p><p>Sometimes the search identified excerpts that suggested that later in the course the student had developed a conception that fit better with standard mathematical usage. I saw such excerpts not as disconfirming evidence of a hypothesis but rather as partial evidence of learning.</p><p>The detailed and global analyses produced preliminary descriptions and representations of students' concept images for the key concepts in the course. These were compared with what I took to be standard language usage and descriptions of the concepts in the mathematical community. This comparison was implicit, at first, in the sense that during the analysis, I was particularly interested in language or understanding that did not fit with my own, which I took to be a fair representation of standard mathematical usage.</p><p>Because both my interview technique and the method of analysis took as a guiding principle the pursuit of that which was interesting, unusual, or unexpected, many discrepancies with standard usage were explored in detail during the interviews themselves, thereby providing substantial supporting data to confirm or disconfirm both the implicit hypotheses that I was generating during the interview and the related hypotheses I was developing during the analysis.</p><p>To make explicit the concept images that implicitly guided my analyses of student thinking, I also completed conceptual analyses of the key concepts in the course, as described below. The various analyses were conducted iteratively. By reflecting on the students' statements, I was often better able to conceptualize and articulate what the conventional concepts are and the distinctions between them. Conversely, with a detailed conceptual analysis I was better able to characterize students' concept images. In this way, comparisons between students' personal meanings and accepted mathematical meaning became increasingly explicit. Because these versions of the accepted mathematical meanings were largely my own creation, some explanation is in order.</p><p>In mature discourse, particularly within a professional community, meaning is often "taken as shared" in the sense that individuals converse as though their personal meaning is shared by the community (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Cobb, Yackel, &amp; Wood, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ernest, 1991</ref>).</p><p>Because no one has direct access to the shared meaning of the mathematical community, it was not possible to import conventional concepts directly into my analysis.</p><p>Furthermore, traditional mathematical exposition would not have been appropriate for this study, because, as Pimm <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(1995)</ref> observes, mathematicians use words as though they are the concepts, as is apparent in mathematical discourse, and symbols as though they are the objects, as is revealed in the metaphor of manipulation. Instead, I created descriptions of the mathematics based on a conceptual analysis that aimed at careful semiotic description of the meanings of the words and representations of the mathematics under study. Guided by my own thinking, frequently consulting resources such as mathematical texts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Gallian, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Herstein, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Hungerford, 1974)</ref>, and with careful consideration of accepted formal definitions, I arrived at a particular elaboration of the meaning of a concept, highlighting its semiotic nature and including process, object, and metaphorical characterizations. I take these meanings to be shared by the community, in the sense that the descriptions fit with, though they are not identical to, descriptions I found in texts I consulted.</p><p>As the detailed, global, and conceptual analyses proceeded, my preliminary observations about student understanding were combined, reworded, and sometimes dropped, leading to working hypotheses that were categorized eventually under two broad themes: the use of language and notation and the mathematical meanings that students gave to their activity. Although my intent was originally to describe students' concept images for a list of concepts, these themes became increasingly prominent as the analysis continued, eventually overtaking the mathematical content categories in importance. Furthermore, it became clear that these emergent themes provided not components but rather characteristics of concept images. Thus, the research questions were adjusted to reflect this observation, resulting in the versions given in chapter 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characterizing the Method</head><p>The working hypotheses evolved over the course of the analysis into a theory that was organized under the two themes. Analysis, synthesis, and theory generation were conducted iteratively and sometimes simultaneously. In other words, by frequently returning to the initial analyses and to the data themselves to judge the faithfulness of the emerging theory and the accompanying explanations, I established the theory in an empirically grounded way.</p><p>Very late in the process, I realized that the detailed summaries functioned as codes, the preliminary observations served as initial categories and hypotheses, and the synthesis of the working hypotheses formed the core of an emergent theory. It is now apparent that, disregarding the false starts, the method is consistent with the constant comparative method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Glaser and Strauss (1967;</ref><ref type="bibr">see Cobb &amp; Whitenack, 1996</ref>, for a similar discussion). Theoretical constructs were developed as part of the data analysis, and the constructs are grounded in the sense that they are rooted in the data. The inferences made while analyzing the episodes formed working hypotheses that were constantly compared to the data and modified in light of new data and analysis, and the theory emerged via this process. The methodology also emerged as I abandoned unproductive approaches and instead focused on what the data afforded. Explicit description of the method was made only retrospectively.</p><p>What was hardest about the process that eventually led to this method was coming to the realization that there was no need to be apologetic about the fact that my initial research questions were vague and that I could not stick to a coding scheme. From the start, the goal of this study had been to develop new understandings of the ways that students learn abstract algebra. When the study began, the only extant theory had been grown out of Dubinsky's (1991) APOS framework, and I suspected right away that the APOS framework missed and even obscured important issues for the learning and teaching of advanced mathematics. Now it is apparent that my aim all along was theory generation, which is precisely what the constant comparative method is intended to support.</p><p>As for the coding, by thinking up the coding scheme in advance, the subsequent attempts at statement-by-statement coding required that I impose (or force) preconceived categories onto the data. The coding did not work precisely because the codes did not fit the data. What I should have done instead was let the codes and categories emerge from the data, and that was the end result, despite the several dead ends that were explored.</p><p>To be precise, however, not all of the codes emerged from the data. In particular, coding and categorizing by mathematical content was intended in the early conceptualization of the study and remained important throughout. The fact that these categories were imposed on the data seems reasonable because they are natural in a sense, because I was interested in the learning of specific mathematical content, and because these categories organize important learning goals. Thus, because of these preconceived categories, the resulting theory is not entirely grounded in the sense of <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Glaser (1992)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship with Grounded Theory</head><p>I have mentioned that the method of this study is consistent with the constant comparative method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Glaser and Strauss (1967)</ref>, but that seminal book is more often cited (with little detail) for the methodology of grounded theory. In this section, I fill in some of the oft-missing detail and explain the relationship between the constant comparative method and grounded theory. This discussion is particularly important because Glaser and Strauss themselves later disagreed about the methodological requirements of constant comparison and grounded theory <ref type="bibr">(compare Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Glaser, 1992)</ref>. I follow Glaser's account because it seems to me to be more faithful to the notions of groundedness and emergence.</p><p>The constant comparative method forms the methodological backbone in the development of grounded theory. Regarding the formulation of a research problem, Glaser (1992) suggests, "Remember and trust that the research problem is as much discovered as the process that continues to resolve it" (p. 21). As for reviewing the literature, Glaser dictates that the researcher not review any of the relevant literature in the field of study (p. 31), because the theoretical constructs in the literature may contaminate the analysis, steering the researcher toward imposing preconceived categories on the data. Any theory that grows through the constant comparative method I will call an emergent theory, usage that fits with the work of Glaser and much of the work of Cobb and his colleagues (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Cobb &amp; Whitenack, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>How do the constant comparative method and an emergent theory satisfy the traditional research ideals of validity and reliability? <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Glaser (1992)</ref> suggests that the criteria by which to judge the theory are not verification and reproducibility but rather fit, work, relevance, and modifiability. When the goal of a study is theory generation, verification</p><p>is not necessary if the theory fits, although future studies might undertake verification.</p><p>Furthermore, it matters not whether another researcher would have produced the same theory but rather whether the theory fits the data, works to explain the variation in the data, is relevant to the context from which the data came, and is modifiable to accommodate the integration of additional concepts.</p><p>In the following chapters, I have tried to include enough detail in the analysis to demonstrate that these four key criteria are satisfied. The final analysis and the emergent theory for this study also essentially satisfied Glaser's prohibitions about the formulation of the research problem and the influence of the relevant literature, if the false starts and missteps are disregarded. Certainly, the original statement of the research problem was sufficiently vague, and the statement of the research problems underwent revisions throughout the process in response to what was available in the data. Regarding the review of the literature, although I read much of the literature ahead of time and did try to force some categories on the data, in the final analysis only the process/object distinction was helpful, and that formed but a small part of the resulting theory. Of course, I also used the notion of concept image, but that construct served mostly as a reminder that I aimed to describe students' understandings broadly, and the construct carried little theoretical baggage that could have been imposed on the data.</p><p>Thus, the methodology of this study was consistent with the constant comparative method, and I call the result an emergent theory. A grounded theory, on the other hand, requires additional methodological commitments. For example, in Glaser's version of grounded theory, data analysis and data collection are iterative so that emerging theories can inform and guide subsequent data collection. I do not see this discrepancy as very serious in this study, although I readily admit that the theory could have been developed further and in more detail if I had been able to alternate analysis and data collection.</p><p>There are two senses, however, in which the design of this study could not lead to a grounded theory. The first sense concerns the imposition of codes for mathematical content, as described above. That was unavoidable. Because the goal was to understand learning in abstract algebra, it was necessary to keep the mathematical content available in the analysis.</p><p>The second discrepancy with the tenets of grounded theory is more fundamental, though it also arises from the attention to mathematical learning. In formulating a research problem, Glaser suggests that the researcher enter the substantive area wondering what the main issue is for the subjects and the processes by which it is handled. Furthermore, it is essential that issue be relevant for the subjects from their perspectives. At least in his field of sociology, it seems that Glaser hopes that the researcher's findings might actually be directly useful to the subjects who participate in the study. Thus, in grounded theory, the subjects' meanings are primary, whereas I was concerned not only with the subjects' meanings but also with the community meanings and the fit between them. As both a researcher and a teacher, I want not only to understand students' conceptions but also to understand how to guide and direct students toward important mathematical ideas and conventional concepts. This perspective was always in the background in the interviews.</p><p>In the analysis, this perspective took a different form: How might we improve the teaching of abstract algebra in particular and advanced mathematics in general?</p><p>It is hard to imagine a grounded theory that is committed to describing students' conceptual understanding and its relationship with conventional concepts as they exist in the mathematical community. In studying students' conceptual understanding, I would suggest that the criteria of fit and relevance are with respect to teachers and researchers primarily and only secondarily with respect to the students. The fact that a theoretical construct is useful for teachers and researchers does not necessarily imply that it will be directly relevant for students, although it is possible to imagine recasting some constructs in ways that might assist students in reflecting on their own thinking and learning. The point is that in judging the theory, fit and relevance for students is at most a secondary consideration. After all, who would suggest that first graders should begin the year with some lessons on assimilation and accommodation?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>This chapter provides a detailed description of the context for this study, including the curriculum, the instruction, and the participants, and the methodology employed. Briefly, this study consists of a semiotic analysis of interviews with students to support the development of theoretical descriptions of their understanding and learning in elementary group theory. The next three chapters provide the results of that analysis, organized according to mathematical content and addressing the three main research questions individually.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CHAPTER V GROUPS AND ISOMORPHISMS</head><p>This chapter presents analysis of students' concept images of binary operation, group, subgroup, and isomorphism, which were the mathematical foci of the first and second interviews. The chapter is organized around the mathematics and thus essentially follows the chronology of the interviews. The bottom-up analysis of these interviews revealed two themes that are threaded throughout this chapter: use of language and use of the operation table. Because these themes are well illustrated by Wendy's interviews, a detailed case study of Wendy's concept images forms the bulk of the chapter, with supporting data from other students and other interviews providing corroborating and contrasting evidence. Each section begins with a description of the interview task, which is followed by an analysis of the mathematics. Then portions of the Wendy's interviews are presented and analyzed, followed by related evidence from other students and other interviews. But first, I provide a short description of Wendy's language and reasoning as an introduction to the chapter's main themes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Wendy's Language and Reasoning</head><p>Wendy often misused words. The analysis of the transcripts of Wendy's interviews was complicated by the fact that many of her misstatements were mere slips of the tongue.</p><p>She would say one thing but meant to say something else. Such an inference is clearly reasonable in two kinds of situations: when Wendy immediately corrected herself and when she restated the idea differently moments later. Because these occurrences were rather frequent, Wendy's language inaccuracies were also interpreted as slips of the tongue when both the context and Wendy's typical usage strongly suggested she intended to say something else. In cases where I do not otherwise call attention to her misstatement, I enclose in brackets what I believe she intended. Not all of Wendy's misstatements were so categorized, however. In particular, her use of the words inverse, identity, commutativity, associativity, and isomorphism indicated conceptual issues that are explored in this analysis.</p><p>Wendy's images of the fundamental concepts in group theory were dominated by the use of operation tables. She often relied on the operation table to provided support for her reasoning and seemed to require that the table be visible in order to begin. The operation table played a metaphorical role in her explanations, appearing to substitute for the group in her reasoning and thinking. Wendy drew conclusions and generalizations from her consideration of the operation tables but also was constrained by her reliance on the tables and found it hard to separate her thinking from them. A related and perhaps consequential phenomenon was that Wendy often considered the group axioms individually, seldom engaging more than one of them at a time in her explanations.</p><p>Wendy's use of the operation table is explored in detail below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Groups and Binary Operations</head><p>As stated in chapter 4, the first interviews began with a question from the literature: "Is Z 3 a subgroup of Z 6 ?" The short answer to this question is no because the operations in the two groups are different. More specifically, because Z 3 is the set {0, 1, 2} under addition modulo 3, and Z 6 is the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} under addition modulo 6, the operations are not the same. For example, 2 + 2 is 4 in Z 6 but 1 in Z 3 . Nonetheless, the subset {0, 2, 4} of Z 6 is simultaneously a subgroup of Z 6 and isomorphic to Z 3 , so there is a sense in which the answer is yes. Both of these ideas were explored in the interviews.</p><p>The literature suggests two reasons for students' difficulties with this question. First, although students think of a group as a set, they are not always sufficiently aware of the operation ( . The second finding in the literature is that some students use a powerful result inappropriately, saying that Z 3 is a subgroup of Z 6 by</p><p>Lagrange's theorem because 3 divides 6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Hazzan &amp; Leron, 1996)</ref>. Because the students</p><p>had not yet been introduced to Lagrange's theorem at the time of the first interview, my intent was not to explore the students' understanding of Lagrange's theorem but to explore the role of the operation in their conceptions of group and subgroup.</p><p>Nonetheless, by exploring subgroups of Z 6 in the interviews, I intended to get at some of the divisibility ideas that are behind Lagrange's theorem. Before providing a detailed description and analysis of the interviews, I offer an analysis of the mathematical concepts of binary operation, group, and subgroup. The analysis is semiotic in the sense that I pay particular attention to names, notations, and other representations, particularly those that were used in this class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptual Analysis</head><p>As described in chapter 1, a group is a set and a binary operation that together satisfy four axioms (closure, associativity, identity, and inverse). The operation gives the group its structure. In other words, a group without its operation is merely a formless collection of elements. In some textbooks, this point is sometimes made notationally, but it is more common to use the set to denote the group, thereby leaving the operation implicit. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Fraleigh (1989)</ref>, for example, at first uses the notation &lt;G, *&gt; to denote the group composed of the set G and the binary operation *. Almost immediately he adopts the shorthand notation:</p><p>At some point, all authors give up and become sloppy, denoting the group by the single letter G. We choose to recognize this and be sloppy from the start. We emphasize, however, that when you are speaking of a specific group, G, you must make it clear what the group operation on G is to be, since a set could conceivably have a variety of binary operations, all giving different groups.</p><p>(p. 40) Using Fraleigh's first notation, &lt;Z n , + n &gt; denotes the group consisting of the set {0, 1, … , n -1} under the operation addition modulo n. In this class, the instructors and students adopted the shorthand, denoting the group merely by Z n . Because the most obvious operations to consider are addition modulo n and multiplication modulo n and because the set Z n is not a group under multiplication modulo n, it is reasonable to say that, for many mathematicians, the phrase "the group Z n " or "the group of integers modulo n"</p><p>carries the implication that the intended operation is addition modulo n (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Gallian, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Hungerford, 1974)</ref>. Nonetheless, this implication was not always obvious to the students.</p><p>The operation on a set may be given in a number of ways, such as by a formula, by a table, or by inheriting an operation from a larger structure in which the set sits. In subsets of the integers, for example, the operations of addition and multiplication may be inherited from the familiar operations on integers. For the sets Z n , however, the operations addition modulo n and multiplication modulo n are not inherited from Z because, for example, 3 + 5 = 8 in Z, but 3 + 5 = 2 in Z 6 .</p><p>For sets with only a few elements, the table was the predominant representation of binary operations for this class. Even with sets such as Z 3 and Z 6 , for both addition modulo n and multiplication modulo n, the students typically created tables that served to support their reasoning.</p><p>Just as a group is a set with structure provided by an operation, a subgroup is not merely a subset of a group but rather a substructure, and the structure is provided by the operation of the group. General insight into the structure can be provided by Lagrange's theorem, which says that in a finite group the order of a subgroup (the number of elements in the subgroup) must be a factor of the order of the group. The converse of the theorem is false in general, as discussed in chapter 3, although it is elegantly true for Z n :</p><p>For each divisor d of n, there is a unique subgroup of order d, which consists of the multiples of n/d. In the task at hand, although Z 3 is not a subgroup of Z 6 , the multiples of 2 in Z 6 are the subset {0, 2, 4}, which is a subgroup of Z 6 and which is isomorphic to Z 3 , as mentioned above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Wendy, Groups, and Binary Operations</head><p>The beginning of Wendy's interview was marked by uncertainty. She first tried to understand the question: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>11</head><p>Wendy: I am taking Z 6 to be integers mod 6. And I don't know what's leading me to think that. But, so, but if it is…. Can I just say, "if it is …"?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>12</head><p>Brad: Sure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>13</head><p>Wendy: A total table. It would consist of 6 items or elements, and for…. It has to be mod 6. Z 6 . It has to be integers mod 6, because…. Well, we have to also figure out an operation, also, too. So now you have the elements, you know Z 6 . We have to know the operation because that will be [inaudible] whether or not it's going to be a subgroup.</p><p>Wendy was unsure of what Z 6 was, what the operation should be, and whether it was a group. Nonetheless, she made some assumptions. Using the wording of my question, she assumed Z 6 to be a group. She also assumed Z 6 to be integers mod 6, but her statement "Z 6 is just mod 6" (line 5), with its odd syntax, suggests she may have been thinking as much about the process of calculating the remainders as about the set of remainders. Later in the interview, she confirmed this impression, saying, "I'm assuming Z 6 means it's integers mod 6, which means you look at the remainders after dividing by 6" (line 32). The students' understanding of modular arithmetic is considered in detail in chapter 7.</p><p>Wendy's phrase "a total Thus, although Wendy's concept images of group, subgroup, and binary operation were insufficient to provide a quick answer to the interview question, her concept images were sufficient to provide general framing of the question at hand. In particular, she saw that it would be helpful to determine first whether the operation in Z 6 was addition or multiplication. The fact that she didn't say "addition modulo n" suggests that she may not have been distinguishing between addition and addition modulo n, and similarly for multiplication. I did not pursue this distinction in the interview but merely suggested that she try both possibilities. She started with multiplication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>20</head><p>Wendy: Okay. Well, Z 6 is not going to be, when I start with my chart, and I do the first row, 0 times any element is going to equal 0, so if you look at that…. Actually, okay. Let me just…. It's not going to have…. You have to…. I'll just finish it. Okay, now it has to hold four properties to be a group. Let's write these down. It has to have an identity, an inverse, it has to be closed, and it has to be associative, which we're going to leave for last. <ref type="bibr">[Laughs]</ref> During this statement, Wendy set up an operation table and filled out the "0" row and column (see <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). She also wrote down the names of the four group axioms to assist her, it appears, in the process of checking whether Z 6 is a group under multiplication. Wendy continued filling out the table, checking the identity and inverse properties as she went along:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>22</head><p>Wendy: So it has an identity, which is 1, which is the identity … which is the identity for every element, identity equals 1. But inverse … </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>28</head><p>Wendy: So Z 6 does have an identity. Now, inverse. Inverse means when you multiply…. If you have a number in Z 6 , there has to be a number in which when you, a number so that when you multiply it, you will get the identity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>30</head><p>Wendy: So m times the inverse. I don't know how I should represent the inverse. Identity is usually…. I am going to change it so that my identity being represented as e, and then I am going to change the inverse as i. So when you multiply some number m by, it has to have an inverse i, so that when multiplied, it will equal the identity. This excerpt provides the first clear hint that Wendy was thinking about the identity and inverse properties in similar ways. She struggled to articulate each of the concepts and arrived at definitions (lines 24 and 28) and notations (lines 24 and 30) that were similar.</p><p>Furthermore, her syntax suggested that to some extent the names of the concepts had been swapped in her thinking. For example, when talking about the identity, she used the phrase "for every element" (line 22), which is more typical when talking about inverses.</p><p>Similarly, her phrase "m times the inverse" (line 30) employs syntax more typical of statements about the identity element. A more correct phrasing would be "m times its inverse," which makes the dependence on m explicit. A search of the transcript reveals that Wendy had used similar syntax for the two concepts when listing the group axioms earlier in the interview: "It has to have an identity, an inverse" (line 20).</p><p>Wendy explicitly used the table to verify the identity property (line 26). Similarly, after explaining her calculations for the row labeled "2," she used the table to explain how the inverse property failed:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>34</head><p>Wendy: So if you look at the second row [the "2" row], there is no number when you multiply…. If you take m equalling 2, if you take a number equalling 2, when you multiply, there is nothing to multiply by 2 to get-in mod 6, cause it has to be an element, to be closed, you can only work with the elements within mod 6. And I have tried every element, 0, 1 … 0 through 5, multiplied by 2 to see if I can get the identity, 1, and I can't get it. So therefore, Z 6 is not a group under multiplication. So, I don't think we should look at it, check to see if Z 3 is a subgroup of Z 6 when Z 6 isn't even a group under multiplication.</p><p>Wendy was about to begin considering addition but stopped herself to make a comment about multiplication:</p><p>38 Wendy: Actually, up here, in multiplication, I didn't even have to look at the second row [the "2" row] because if you look at 0 there is nothing you can multiply by 0 to get the identity element back, 1, because 0 times every element is going to equal 0.</p><p>It seems that at this point, Wendy had reduced the process of checking the inverse property to a process of looking for the identity, 1, in a particular row in the table, for not only was she able to see from the table that the element 1 did not appear in the "2" row, but she also noticed that 1 did not appear in the "0" row, which provided a more immediate reason for the failure of the inverse property under multiplication. This process either provides a partial explanation for or is partly explained by the close relationship between the identity and inverse properties in Wendy's thinking. The word inverse was not present in her justification, however. I asked her to explain:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>39</head><p>Brad: So what does that say about 0 there?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>40</head><p>Wendy: 0 cannot be an element in Z 6 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>41</head><p>Brad: 0. But you are saying it is an element though, because …</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>42</head><p>Wendy: Oh yeah; 0 is an element in Z 6 , but it doesn't have an inverse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>43</head><p>Brad: Oh, okay.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>44</head><p>Wendy: Because you can't…. There's not…. When you multiply 0 by anything, you can't get the identity element. And this doesn't help. So that just doesn't seem…. Like, if you are going to have a group, you couldn't, 0 couldn't be in it. A group under multiplication, it couldn't include 0.</p><p>Thus, Wendy's statement that "0 cannot be an element in Z 6 " (line 40), was a specific instance of a general principle: A group, under multiplication, cannot include 0. It is not surprising that Wendy wanted to exclude elements that did not satisfy desired properties, because this is essentially the idea behind the construction of the groups of units modulo n. In the introduction to the groups U n , the class used a more general version of this principle: Include only elements from Z n that have multiplicative inverses.</p><p>Wendy next began considering whether Z 6 is a group under addition. She constructed a new operation table <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">(Figure 6</ref>), checking the axioms as she went along.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>47</head><p>Wendy: Now if you look at addition, I am going to fill out the table the same way, except with addition. I'm going to just look at the remainders when divided by 6. We can see, I</p><p>can see by filling out the first table <ref type="bibr">[row]</ref> that the identity…. Also, I think it is a global property, that since integers, the identity is going to equal zero. That, if you take a subgroup of…. But then we are going to go into another issue, whether Z 6 is a subgroup of, in the integers. But I think if integers has an identity of 0 under addition, that Z 6 will also have the identity 0. It works. </p></div>

The term is based on the idea that if an operation is associative on an entire set, then the property must hold for any subset.</p><p>The term is nonstandard, although the idea closely resembles the meaning of the more conventional phrase "associativity is inherited from the group." This excerpt shows that Wendy had expanded her use of the term to describe a similar idea for the identity property. She was correct, in a sense, in that when verifying the identity property for a subset of a group, it is sufficient to show that the identity element is in the subset, rather than showing that it serves as the identity for all elements in the subset. It is not clear, however, whether she had in mind this precise use of the word. In any case, the "global" idea was not appropriate here because addition in the integers and addition in Z 6 are different operations. Thus, this excerpt suggests imprecision in Wendy's concepts of global and of addition. These issues are explored in more detail below.</p><p>Wendy continued verifying the group axioms:</p><p>50 Wendy: So next I am going to check the inverse property. And 0 has an inverse so 0 + 1, or…. Excuse me. Since 0 is the identity we have to check that when you add 0 to 0 you get the identity 0. So 0 is the inverse element for itself. And then 1. When you multiply, when you add 1 and 5 it equals 6, but that equals 0 (mod 6) cause 6 is divisible by 6. That's pretty obvious, but…. So 1 has a inverse. 2 has an inverse because 2 + 4 = 6, which equals 0. 3 + 3 has an in-…. equals 0 (mod 6). 4 + 2 = 0 (mod 6). And 5 + 1 = 0 (mod 6). So each element has an inverse. So you know that Z 6 is a group under addition.</p><p>Here, Wendy correctly verified the inverse property by using the table to find the inverse of each element. She supported this process by making a check mark alongside each row of the table as she identified the corresponding inverse. She momentarily considered 1 as the identity but corrected this on her own. Apart from her self-corrections, she used appropriate language throughout this verification, which culminated in the statement "each element has an inverse." Wendy's language and calculations, taken together, suggest that she could distinguish identity and inverse properties according to the conventional meanings, although the distinction became less clear again later in the interview.</p><p>Although Wendy's verification of the inverse property was essentially correct, she was premature in declaring that Z 6 is a group under addition because she had not yet checked all the properties. Because she immediately went on to check closure, however, it seems likely that she had in mind a preliminary rather than final conclusion. In verifying the closure and associative properties, Wendy explicitly referred to the table to support her reasoning:</p><p>51 Wendy: And then it's closed. You can see that there are no elements other than 0 through 5, looking at the chart, because we have all possible combinations on elements in Z 6 . So it is closed also.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>52</head><p>Wendy: And associative. You can see, because the chart has symmetry, that the group will be, is associative. This is how I look at it, anyway, because if you look at 2 × 5 you are going to get 1 and if you look at 2 + 5 you get 1. But also you know it is Z 6 , is also because it's a global property, because addition is associative, for integers, and you know that this carries over to subgroups and so Z 6 will be associative under addition. Do you want me to explain that further?</p><p>Wendy made several errors in her attempt to verify associativity. First she stated that she was comparing 2 + 5 and 2 × 5 when, based on her statement about the symmetry in the table, she probably was comparing 2 + 5 and 5 + 2. A more significant error was that she was describing commutativity but calling it associativity. Furthermore, the penultimate sentence implies that she thought that Z 6 is a subgroup of Z. During the interview, I</p><p>pursued the first two errors. Thus, Wendy was able to correct both errors on her own. Because it took her a moment to realize that her description was about commutativity, it appears that the commutative and associative properties were closely related, perhaps even overlapping, in Wendy's thinking.</p><p>Wendy used the idea that associativity is a global property to complete her verification, but again the idea was not appropriate because addition in the integers and addition in Z 6 are different operations. I did not pursue this issue explicitly in the interview but instead asked Wendy only to verify the property for the example she gave.</p><p>At this point, I put aside the case of Wendy to extend the analysis to other students, discussing, in particular, the concept of binary operation, the relationship between associativity and commutativity, and the notion of global properties. In this section, I</p><p>further develop some of the themes that have emerged thus far, including language use and the use of the operation table.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Binary Operation</head><p>Operation confusion. One of the most persistent occurrences throughout the interviews was a phenomenon I initially called operation confusion, where students were unsure of the appropriate operation on a set. As might have been expected, operation confusion was more likely to occur when more than one operation was available, such as in Z n , where there are two natural operations. All the key participants experienced operation confusion during the first interview, and most had at least momentary confusion in the third interview when dealing with a function from U 8 to Z 4 . All these groups, it should be pointed out, have elements that look like integers but that do not behave quite like the integers with which the students were familiar.</p><p>In the first interviews, none of the key participants was immediately sure about the operations that would be appropriate for answering the question "Is Z 3 a subgroup of Z 6 ?"</p><p>Carla, for example, stated at first that the operation must be multiplication "because the addition wasn't a group mod n…. Something about multiples of n" (line 12). She then verified that the group axioms are satisfied under addition modulo n, showed that the group axioms are not satisfied for multiplication modulo n, and realized that she had remembered incorrectly.</p><p>Robert, on the other hand, was at first convinced that Z 6 is not a group under multiplication, "because the inverses aren't in Z 6 " (line 9), a statement that was essentially correct and might have led him quickly to consider addition modulo 6.</p><p>Moments later, however, he stated that the inverse of 1 would be "1 over 1, just 1" (line 15), demonstrating that he was thinking of inverses as fractions. Then he used analogous reasoning for addition in Z 6 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>20</head><p>Robert: So, but that's not a group either because in Z 6 if each inverse is itself, the negative of itself, which isn't in Z 6 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>21</head><p>Brad: What do you mean?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>22</head><p>Robert: Like 1 + -1 will equal 0, so -1 is 1's inverse, but -1 isn't in Z 6 .</p><p>At this point in the interview, Robert was unsure whether Z 6 is a group at all. By making operation tables for both operations, he was able to resolve these issues, although he first stated that 3 is the inverse of 2 under multiplication because the product is 0, demonstrating some difficulty keeping his additive and multiplicative thinking separate.</p><p>It is likely that the students' operation confusion was caused in part by the fact that the class had spent time at the beginning of the course solving both multiplicative and additive equations in Z n . It may also be, however, that the notational convention of writing the group operation multiplicatively when is not specified promotes multiplicative thinking in additive situations such as this.</p><p>During the first interviews, resolving operation confusion consumed considerable time for all of the key participants, but as the semester progressed, the students developed more efficient and accurate methods of determining and keeping track of the operation.</p><p>For example, they used either the identity or closure properties to deduce that the operation in U 8 is multiplication and not addition: One might hope that determining a group's operation would become a matter of recall.</p><p>But the evidence suggests some subtlety in the learning process: The students developed increasingly efficient strategies for determining a group's operation. This hypothesis is analogous to the development of proficiency in other areas of mathematics, most notably in the learning of the basic number combinations: Rather than moving from slow object- based procedures to recall, young children proceed along a trajectory of increasingly efficient procedures until the combinations are based either on recall or on procedures that are indistinguishable from recall (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Kilpatrick et al., 2001</ref>, chapter 6). Thus, the phenomenon of operation confusion may be viewed as a natural stage in the development of proficiency with group theory and its standard examples.</p><p>Diamond and star. Another explanation for operation confusion may be an inevitable consequence of one of the goals for the course: an abstract concept of binary operation.</p><p>So that all binary operations, including familiar additions and multiplications, might be seen as instances of a single idea, Dr. Benson and I chose sometimes to use a neutral notation for the operation. Clearly the notations +, ×, or ⋅ would not provide such neutrality. Thus, we often used ◊ (diamond) or * (star) to denote an unspecified operation. One could argue that * does not provide the intended neutrality because the symbol is often used in computer programming languages to denote multiplication. This is certainly a concern, although it is no more problematic than the common practice in abstract algebra texts of leaving the operation implied, as in ab, a convention that clearly carries overtones of multiplication. Even the more neutral ◊ (diamond), however, was problematic, as is illustrated by Diane and Lori as they tried to determine the operation in Diane had begun to construct operation tables but quickly reconsidered: Thus, despite their momentary disagreement, Lori and Diane both saw diamond not so much as a label for an abstraction under which a number of familiar operations could sit but rather as a device to use when the operation was unfamiliar or unknown.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Z 3 .</formula><p>Furthermore, it seems that Lori had similar thinking about the notational uses of a and b, in the sense that the letters were not generic labels for group elements but rather unfamiliar objects that she did not know how to add. Thus, even the most neutral notation did not necessarily lead students to the desired abstraction. Late in the course, some students had developed a reasonably robust concept of binary operation, as evidenced by the fact that they were able to switch effortlessly between additive and multiplicative notation and language. Wendy, for example, compared the expression a*a between U 8 and Z 4 by noting, "Here we're squaring it, but here we're saying 2a" (Interview 3, line 156). This ability led sometimes to problematic or awkward syntax. Robert, for example, called 6 a power of 3 because "If you operate 3 with itself you get 6" (Interview 3, line 272).</p><p>Sometimes, however, the switch between multiplicative and additive notation and language was not so effortless, and multiplicative language seemed to dominate. In one interview, for example, I asked Carla to find the subgroup generated by 3 in Z 12 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>15</head><p>Carla: There would be 3, and 9 would be in it because 3 squared is 9. And 0 would be in it because…. Well, actually, Z 12 is a group under addition. So it's not…. I can't really think of it as 3 squared…. So 9 is in it, but not because it's 3 squared. 9 is in it because it's 3 cubed when you are adding. So, in other words three 3s. <ref type="table">(Interview 4)</ref> It took Carla a moment to establish additive thinking, and still she maintained some multiplicative language, leading to awkward phrases such as "3 cubed when you are adding." Later in the same interview, when explaining the sense in which {0, 3, 6, 9} can be an identity element, she indicated some discomfort with the broad use of multiplicative language:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>65</head><p>Carla: Okay if you add ... We have often called it multiplying, but I don't like that term because to me it doesn't ... I just don't like the idea of multiplying; it doesn't make sense. So I prefer to think of combining them.</p><p>In summary, the notion of an abstract binary operation presented notational, conceptual, and even linguistic issues. Coming to view various operations as instances of the same idea was a slow process. Standard notations such as + or ⋅ have associated language and thus associated meaning. New notations, such as diamond, were sometimes seen not to represent new abstract categories but rather new operations.</p><p>Regarding the concept of binary operation, the students demonstrated on the one hand that they didn't sufficiently distinguish between various operations called addition. On the other hand, they demonstrated that they imposed nonstandard distinctions between notations for generic operations such as * and notations for familiar operations such as ⋅ or +. The students also had trouble maintaining the standard distinctions between associativity and commutativity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Associativity and Commutativity</head><p>It should not be surprising that Wendy sometimes confused the concepts of commutativity and associativity, for the concepts are indeed closely related. And in fact, other students also demonstrated similar confusion. Conceptual analysis, supported by a closer look at the data, provides several possible explanations for the close relationship and the confusion between the concepts. This section builds an explanation out of description of the definitions, distinguishing examples, and verification processes for the concepts of associativity and commutativity.</p><p>Definitions Not all students were careful about the quantifiers. Wendy, for example, stated on her final exam that "an operation is commutative if for 2 elements a and b, a*b = b*a."</p><p>Students' definitions and statements often noted that commutativity is about two elements and that associativity is about three elements, suggesting that this was a salient distinction between the two concepts. In fact, this is the most obvious difference in the definitions.</p><p>Few distinguishing examples. Second, although associativity and commutativity are often discussed in high school mathematics, most elementary examples of noncommutative operations, such as subtraction and division of real numbers, are also nonassociative. Experiences in high school mathematics might lead to concepts of associativity and commutativity that are merged into an "order doesn't matter" property.</p><p>Wendy said almost exactly this in her fourth interview: "Because it's associative, you can move it all around" (line 213). Furthermore, Diane's final exam included similar claims about commutativity: "This property allows us to switch around the elements in an expression so that it doesn't matter which elements will operate first." Unless students' linear algebra courses emphasized the fact that matrix multiplication is associative but not commutative, this abstract algebra class may have provided students their first opportunity to separate their conceptions of the two properties. Separating the concepts might require at least a few distinguishing examples, but the group axioms suggest an asymmetry: Associativity is more important. In fact, it seems to be difficult to create an operation that is commutative but not associative, particularly via an operation table <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">(Zaslavsky &amp; Peled, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Benson, in press</ref>).</p><p>Verification. There are other important differences between the concepts of associativity and commutativity, particularly regarding their verification processes. Commutativity is often easy to infer from a description of an operation, and when the operation is given via a Associativity, on the other hand, is hard to see in an operation table. When an operation is given via a table, the number of calculations required to verify the property is prohibitively high even for groups with as few as 4 elements. When an operation is given via a description or a formula, there are a number of possible approaches, each with its own subtleties. In class, we took essentially three approaches to the problem of associativity. For operations given via operation tables, we often used Exploring Small</p><p>Groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Geissinger, 1989)</ref> to let the computer perform the tedious calculations. At other times, we verified associativity via symbolic proof. Perhaps the most common approach, however, was to argue that associativity was inherited from a larger structure in which the desired structure lived. In class, this approach was used uncritically and incorrectly by many students and took on a life of its own under the label "Associativity is global."</p><p>This phenomenon is discussed in more detail below.</p><p>These differences between commutativity and associativity provide a third reason for the confusion and also explain the fact that the confusion was essentially one directional:</p><p>Students sometimes said associative and meant commutative, but I found no evidence of the opposite. I do not contend that the opposite confusion never occurs but suggest instead that commutativity is more likely to be present in a student's mind. First, it is easier to think about two elements at a time than it is to think about three. Second, commutativity is such a useful property and such a prominent visual feature of an operation table, students are likely to focus on it rather than associativity, despite the fact that commutativity is not one of the group axioms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Global Properties</head><p>Verifying that a set and an operation satisfy the associativity axiom requires particular attention to the operation. As mentioned above, sometimes the associativity of an operation on a set is inherited from a larger structure in which the set and operation are situated.</p><p>All key participants applied this "global property" idea inappropriately at some point during the interviews, typically by paying insufficient attention to the operation.</p><p>Furthermore, many of the key participants uncritically generalized the idea to other group axioms.</p><p>Both Lori and Robert, for example, claimed that associativity in Z 6 was inherited from Z:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>83</head><p>Lori: And it's associative because addition is associative and that's inherited from the larger group Z under addition. So that's why it's a subgroup.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>69</head><p>Robert: We are talking about Z 6 . These are integers, and integers fall in the associative law, so it's associative.</p><p>Carla demonstrated similar thinking but with more generality and with idiosyncratic language, calling the set Z n "mod n." (See chapter 7 for detailed discussion of Carla's use of the phrase "mod n.")</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>79</head><p>Carla: So the next thing to check would be associativity. But mod n is a subset of Z because all of your elements in mod n are integers and Z under addition is associative, so therefore mod n under addition is associative. So therefore mod n under addition is a group.</p><p>Earlier in the same interview, Carla had similarly claimed that Z 3 inherits associativity from Z 6 : properly supported by consideration of the operation, despite their correctness.</p><p>Like Wendy, other students broadened the idea of global or inherited properties beyond associativity. The notion that the identity is global was perhaps implicit in many students' claims that 0 is the identity for addition, in the sense that the statement holds for a wide variety of representations of groups, with many distinct operations called addition.</p><p>Of course, the same can be said of 1 as the identity for multiplication.</p><p>Diane and Lori argued explicitly that the identity in Z 3 is inherited from Z 6 (lines 78-80).</p><p>As in the case with Wendy, it is possible that Diane and Lori intended merely that they did not need to show that 0 behaved as an identity in the subset. This simple explanation seems particularly unlikely, however, in light of Diane's subsequent claim that an element's inverse need not be the same in a subgroup as it is in the group:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>94</head><p>Diane: The only thing that it says about inherited inverses is that you get the inverse of 1 is 2 here and 2 is an element of this Z 6 . It doesn't say that the inverse of 1 has to be 2 in here; it just says that 2 is in this, it doesn't say that it has to be the same.</p><p>Diane's concept of inverse seems especially problematic here in the sense that the inverse of an element is unique and thus will not change when restricting to a subgroup. On the other hand, on the assumption that Diane had a broad notion of inherited properties-a notion that did not pay much attention to the operation-then it follows that she would say something about inverses in Z n being inherited from Z. Then, because the inverse of 5 is -5 in Z but 1 in Z 6 , her statement would make sense. This hypothesis is made more plausible on the basis of additional evidence of Diane's broad use of the idea of inherited properties. Particular compelling evidence is provided by an earlier claim of some kind of inheritance by Z 3 from Z n :</p><p>44 Diane: Well Z 3 isn't a subgroup of Z 6 , it's at least a subgroup of Z n and we know that Z n is a group under addition, so it would have inherited property.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was insufficient data to make much sense out of what Diane meant by Z n here. Nonetheless, it is clear that her notion of inherited properties was broader than associativity and was insufficiently tied to the operation.</p><p>One potential explanation for students' improper generalization of the idea of global properties is that that term itself is nonstandard and lacks a formal definition. The data suggest, however, that the more standard term inherited was also problematic.</p><p>Furthermore, formalizing either of these terms would have been essentially the same exercise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subgroups and Binary Operations</head><p>At this point, the discussion returns to the case of Wendy to present detailed analysis of </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 7. Wendy's table for addition in Z 6 , second version</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>+ 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 1 1 2 3 4 5 0 2 2 3 4 5 0 1 3 3 4 5 0 1 2 4 4 5 0 1 2 3 5 5 0 1 2 3 4</head><p>Thus, through her reliance on the table, Wendy had correctly identified the central issue behind the interview question: whether the addition was to take place based on the operation in Z 3 or in Z 6 . Nonetheless, she was not ready to come to a conclusion:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>86</head><p>Wendy: See, it doesn't make sense. Like, I started over here to do, to look at whether or not Z 3 was a group itself, but that didn't make sense to me.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>87</head><p>Brad: What didn't make sense?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>88</head><p>Wendy: To look independently to see whether Z 3 was a group under addition. Actually, I think for the same reasons it is going to be a group under addition, just like Z 6 . I think any Z group under addition is going to be a group because 0 is going to be…. Well, I guess it depends what elements are in there, but…. Like Z 3 is going to be a group, it's easy to see after looking at Z 6 . But if you just look at it separately, it doesn't really make sense whether, like, to tell whether or not Z 3 is a subgroup of Z 6 to just look at whether Z 3 is group because it has no connection with Z 6 .</p><p>It is surprising that Wendy was not able to make general statements about "any Z group" but instead stated "it depends what elements are in there." Perhaps this is merely evidence that she needed to see the operation table in front of her. Nonetheless, she was concerned that there should be a clear connection between a subgroup and the group that it was supposed to come from. Earlier statements indicate that she thought the connection should come via the operation table.</p><p>To provide some clarity, I first asked Wendy to compare the two different versions of 2 + 2 that she had discussed. She explained:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>92</head><p>Wendy: This is going to equal 1 in Z 3 mod 3 because that equals, 2 + 2 = 4. In mod 3 that is going to equal, the remainder's 1. But here it's only, it's still going to be 4 because it's mod 6.</p><p>Next, I checked briefly why Wendy had not pursued multiplication as the operation in Z 3 .</p><p>(Misused words are set in bold to help call attention to them in the following discussion.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>95</head><p>Wendy: Well Z 3 isn't going to be a subgroup, isn't going to be a group under multiplication because if you look at the first row it's going to equal the same thing as it was up here. Like, they have very similar relationships, the Z tables. Like, Z 3 under multiplication has a similar relationship to Z 6 multiplication table, as does Z 3 under addition and Z 6 under addition. Like they are going to have the same identity under multiplication and division <ref type="bibr">[addition]</ref>. So if you look at Z 3 under multiplication I'd know that the first row is going to be-I'm going to fix this-is going to be 0's and from here you know that 0 does not have a, doesn't have an identity element, or an inverse, excuse me. So you know already.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>99</head><p>Wendy: There are no elements in Z 3 when multiplied by 0 will give you the identity 1. That's why you know that, again, for the same reason, Z 3 is not going to be a group under multiplication.</p><p>Wendy had trouble saying what she meant here, correcting her language twice (group for subgroup and inverse for identity) and also meaning addition but saying division.</p><p>Nonetheless, it seems that she was reasonably confident about the fact that Z 3 is not a group under multiplication (mod 3). But to get some clarity on the extent to which</p><p>Wendy associated an operation with Z n , I asked her about Z 10 .</p><p>Thus, Wendy still had trouble using the words she meant, saying addition when she meant multiplication. Furthermore, her syntax "not going to have an inverse element" is more appropriate for talking about the identity.</p><p>Then we returned to whether Z 3 is a subgroup of Z 6 .</p><p>111 Wendy: Like a subset of…. I think we have to look at it as like part of the set of Z 6 , which, like subgroup, like as a group in Z 6 . So if you look at … which is why I kind of choose the elements Z 3 out of the Z 6 table.</p><p>Wendy was clearly thinking of Z 6 as more than a set and as Z 3 as more than a subset. She was choosing not "elements Z 3 out of the Z 6 table," but rather entries out of the Z 6 table that corresponded to the restriction of the binary operation to the subset Z 3 . On the conviction that this was the appropriate method, Wendy decided that Z 3 is not a subgroup of Z 6 because the subset was not closed under the operation.</p><p>The fact that she had answered my question was apparently of little concern, however, for she immediately began focusing on the manner in which closure had failed. In particular, she looked at the 3 and 4 that appeared in top left quarter of the Z 6 table (see <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>).  </p></div>

Because, in other words, you can make that table…. You can't look at the other elements. You can't look at the whole row, 3 and 5. You know what I mean? Because you can only look at the addition of those two. You can't start including 0, 1, 2 added to three, because you have to restrict it to three if you are to restrict it to 3 and 5, in order for it to be closed. So if I am going to look at the addition of just 3 and 5 [pause] 0 <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> doesn't have an id-, a inverse element. Furthermore, she justified this view by noting that "you can make that a table" (line 150).</p><p>From this view, she noticed that 5 does not have an inverse in {3, 5}, although she said at first that 0 does not have an inverse, perhaps because she had been looking for a 0 in that row. Then, perhaps prompted by the fact that 5 lacks an inverse in {3, 5}, Wendy decided to begin with the set {1, 5} to see whether it was a subgroup of Z 6 .</p><p>As the interview continued, she focused on the inverse property.</p><p>156 Wendy: Let me pick 1 and 5. 1 and 5, and that would give you…. I'll tell you how I am going to do this. 1 and 1 is going to give you 2. 5 and 5 is going to give you 4. And 1 and 5, and 5 and 1, is going to give you 0.</p><p>157 Brad: Okay.</p><p>158 Wendy: You see that 1 and 5 both have an inverse. So, ooh.  Although the previous excerpt suggested that Wendy had chosen {1, 5} so that it would satisfy the inverse property, it seems in this excerpt that she was unsure whether this choice would work until she had considered the operation table. Her syntax about the relationship between 1 and 5 was somewhat confused and inconsistent, however, evolving from "have an inverse" to "are each other inverse elements."</p><p>At the same time, it is apparent that Wendy was thinking only about the inverse property.</p><p>If she had been thinking about closure, she would have noticed during her calculations that closure was not satisfied. Furthermore, she was ready to consider the identity property only after she had completed her verification of the inverse property. Drawing on a procedure developed in class, Wendy considered adding elements to the set in order to build the subgroup one element at a time. Here she realized that she needed to include the identity element in order to be sure that the identity property was satisfied.</p><p>This seems to be a significant moment regarding the identity, for from this point on, Wendy always included the identity early when constructing a subgroup. But at this point, she was ignoring closure and was having trouble reasoning about the set {0, 1, 5}</p><p>because the table for Z 6 was cluttered with other elements. Thus, she decided to "move <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">over" the relevant portions of the table into a smaller table containing only the three</ref> elements she was interested in (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">Figure 9</ref>). 170 Wendy: Okay. So, here everything has an … 1 has, everything has…. There is an identity element in here, because 0 is in the table, and therefore 0 added to anything is going to equal the number itself. So zero is everything's identity.</p><p>171 Wendy: So now everything has an inverse, even though you added 0, 0 is its own inverse. So, therefore, you didn't have to worry about changing the inverse, like disturbing the inverse property when you added 0. There are two points to make here. First, Wendy had been considering the group axioms one at a time and did not move flexibly among them. From her laughter and frustration in noticing that the set was not closed, it is clear that she had not considered the closure axiom earlier in this example. Second, this excerpt reinforces the hypothesis that Wendy began constructing the set with 1 and 5 because together they satisfied the inverse property and then added 0 to the set so that there would be an identity element. When she returned to check the inverse property (line 171), she still was thinking of the process by which she had constructed the set, but her reasons for choosing 1 and 5 as a pair were not explicit. This omission may be significant because she seems to have forgotten her reasons only a few minutes later when, taking advantage of her idea to "build up" subgroups, I asked what would happen if she had started with different elements or with only one element:</p><p>186 Brad: If you just started with 1, would you need 5?</p><p>187 Wendy: I don't know. You have to see after you add 2. If you add 2, 2 and 1 is going to equal 3. Then you're going to need 3. 3 and 1 is going to equal 4, and you're going to need 4. And then 4 and 1 is going to equal 5 and you're going to need 5.</p><p>[inaudible]</p><p>188 Brad: Okay. So in other words, if you start with 1, what else do you need?</p><p>189 Wendy: 0 for the identity element. Wendy was no longer thinking of the inverse property, or she would have responded (in line 187) more quickly that 5 was necessary. Instead, she was thinking about closure, which is why 2 needs to be in the subgroup. Continuing the processes of adding 1, she decides that 3, then 4, and eventually 5 must also be in the subgroup.</p><p>At this point in the interview, the identity axiom was fairly immediate and salient, but the inverse axiom had faded into the background, obscured by the closure axiom. Closure remained dominant as the interview continued. Despite Wendy's frustration, she had built up some ways of thinking that allowed her to proceed more quickly. I asked her to try starting with a different element.   Wendy had found a subgroup, and, for the first time in the interview, she considered several axioms in quick succession. Her explanations were somewhat muddled, however.</p><p>In particular, her syntax for the identity and inverse was mostly reversed, suggesting once again that these two properties were closely related in her thinking. She did clarify that all elements have the same identity. I asked for clarification about inverse:</p><p>203 Brad: What's got an inverse?</p><p>204 Wendy: Every element has an inverse. So that's a subgroup.</p><p>Because Wendy corrected her syntax regarding the inverse property, it seems that she could distinguish the inverse property from the identity property, even if the distinction was not automatic.</p><p>Again, it is remarkable that Wendy considered three of the group axioms almost simultaneously, suggesting growing fluency with the axioms. She had said nothing, however, about the associative property. Wendy's response to my question indicated some frustration that all her work had not yet produced something that she could be sure was a subgroup. Nonetheless, she overcame this frustration quickly upon remembering that associativity is a global property. Wendy did not correctly use the idea that associativity is global, however, basing her conclusion on the associativity of addition in Z rather than in Z 6 . Nonetheless, she was correct that {0, 2, 4} is a subgroup.</p><p>Next, I asked Wendy whether there are any other subgroups of Z 6 .</p><p>212 Wendy: I don't know I'd have to play and try. I just found one; I didn't think that we could find one, but I just found one.  Again her syntax regarding the inverse property is more appropriate for talking about the identity, yet her calculations indicate that she did know that each element must have an inverse. And again she considered the inverse, identity, and closure properties in quick succession.</p><p>I asked whether there were any other subgroups. 226 Wendy: 5 is the same thing as 1.</p><p>227 Brad: Why?</p><p>228 Wendy: Because 5 and 5 you are going to need 4, and then 4 and 5 are going to need 3.</p><p>Okay? And then 3 and 4 you going to need 1, you are going to need 0, and 4 and 4 is going to equal 2. So you need everything.</p><p>For both of the examples in this excerpt (starting with 4 and starting with 5), Wendy's arguments were based on the closure property, not the inverse property. The inverse relationship between 5 and 1, which had earlier been quite present in her thinking (see lines 154 and 158), had faded into the background. Instead she focused on the need to satisfy the closure property.</p><p>Next, I asked Wendy whether she saw any relationship between Z 3 and the subgroup {0, 2, 4} in Z 6 . She paused for a moment and then responded: 249 Wendy: Yeah, but if you take every element in Z 3 and you multiply it by 2…. I can't really make that connection yet, like, why that exactly works. I know it definitely has the…. Like, I think it definitely affects the fact that 2 and 4 are factors of 6. Not factors…. Oh, no. They're…. Like 3, when added to itself is going to equal 0. When 2 and 4 are added to each other, you're going to … it's going to keep it closed. Like when you start adding 1 you're switching…. Like, these are two even numbers. The fact that they are two evens, two evens are going to equal an even number. I don't know if it has to do with the evens, but…. I see a definite pattern why these two are going to be subgroups. Because 2 and 4…. 2 and 2 is going to equal 4. 4 and 2 is going to equal 6, and 6 is going to be, 6 is equal to 0. So all these…. Like 2 and 4 when…. I've explained this to you [inaudible] four times. I can't explain…. I don't know.</p><p>[inaudible]</p><p>250 Wendy: Like it makes total sense to me that these two are groups. And I can see why this isn't. So can I re-ask a question or can you re-ask me a question?</p><p>Wendy considered factors and evenness to explain why 2Z 3 would be a subgroup, but neither of these provided a clear explanation. To assist her in searching for the explanation, she sought a new question, suggesting that she saw questioning as a useful means for developing insight and explanation. She continued looking. Toward the end of the interview, however, she had developed more fluency and was able to move quickly among the axioms. Moving toward considering the axioms multiply and flexibly might be described as a matter of increasing proficiency and fluency with the group axioms and with the particular examples, which may be a result of internalization of some of the external processes that were based in the table.</p><p>The </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identity and Inverse</head><p>Like Wendy, the other key participants demonstrated that their concept images of identity and inverse were closely related. In this section, I first present a synthesis of the definitions and informal meanings that students associated with the concepts, followed by a description of the notational, linguistic, and conceptual expectations that the students seemed to have for each of the concepts. Then I provide some additional examples of confusion between the two concepts and some explanations based in procedures and operation tables.</p><p>Definitions and meaning. On the final exam, several students provided definitions of the identity and inverse as part of their definitions of group. Lori, for example, wrote the following:</p><p>There must be the existance <ref type="bibr">[sic]</ref> of an inverse: a ◊ a -1 = e (where e is the identity element).</p><p>There must be an existance <ref type="bibr">[sic]</ref> of an identity: a ◊ e = a (e is the identity element).</p><p>The syntactical similarity between the definitions suggests that the two concepts were closely related in Lori's thinking. Furthermore, the quantifiers and other specifications are missing, yet the formulas are correct in the sense that correct definitions could be crafted around these formulas. This characterization fits many of the definitions that students provided.</p><p>There were also important differences between students' definitions of identity and inverse. In particular, the definition of identity seems to have been more difficult to formulate than the definition of inverse. Compare, for example, Robert's definitions:</p><p>identity -an element e such that a ◊ e = a = e ◊ a.</p><p>inverses -for each a ∈ G there is a -1 ∈ G such that aa -1 = e = a -1 a.</p><p>Though Robert's definition of inverse was essentially correct, including the quantifiers, his definition of identity lacked quantifiers entirely. Wendy's definition of identity was also problematic:</p><p>There is an identity element for the group so that every element in G, when multiplied by this identity element, e, will give you back the original element:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">{x ∈ G | xe = x}.</formula><p>Wendy's informal characterization was essentially correct and included the quantifier "every element in G." The formalization at the end, however, is incorrect. A standard mathematical reading of Wendy's symbolism would be, "The set of x in G such that xe = x" or, more informally, "All x in G such that xe = x." This is not far from the correct condition, "For all x in G, xe = x." Thus, Wendy had specified a set rather than a condition on G, and her unusual symbolism may be interpreted as difficulty with correct symbolic use of quantifiers.</p><p>Informal characterizations such as "giving back the original element" were common for the identity element. On her final exam, Lori noted, "The identity of Z 4 is 0 because 0 plus any element in Z 4 gives back that element." Wendy called the identity the "do- nothing element" (Interview 2, line 306). Carla elevated this characterization to a definition: "So you could call 0 the do-nothing element, which is the way we've defined identity" (Interview 1, line 88). Robert combined these characterizations: "R 0 , which doesn't do anything to them. R 0 composed with any of them leaves them the same. So there is an identity" (Interview 2, line 178).</p><p>Informal characterizations of inverse were more difficult to formulate. Lori, for example, was quite vague: "Because the inverse of something is when you operate two things to equal the identity" (Interview 1, line 87). Recall that Wendy struggled and eventually came to an approximate characterization: "So when you multiply some number m by, it has to have an inverse i, so that when multiplied, it will equal the identity" (line 30).</p><p>Carla, on the other hand, was more precise in her language, even in her first interview.</p><p>She stated, "To get the inverse you have to find something that adds with your element that results in the identity, which is 0 in this case" (line 39). In the same interview, she used similar syntax when she described that for something to be an inverse of 2: "It means that 2 times that thing equals the identity" (line 120).</p><p>Expectations about the identity. The students' images of the identity property seemed partly tied to what the identity was called. In other words, the symbol that was used for the identity (e.g., 0, 1, or e) seemed to support and facilitate the students' thinking. In fact, the students' use of 0 and 1 (and eventually e) was so flexible that it was not possible for me to distinguish between the symbol and the name. Not surprisingly, there were also strong connections between the name of the operation and the expected name of the identity. When the operation was called addition, for example, students expected the identity to be called 0. Then, when determining whether a set was a group or a subgroup, they needed only determine whether 0 was in the set. Similar statements can be made about multiplication and 1. Carla, for example, was explicit about this process:</p><p>168 Carla: So then you want to check the identity. We already said that the identity for integers under addition is 0. So we know that the identity for Z 3 is 0. The question is, Is 0 in Z 3 ? And yes, it is. So therefore we have an identity.</p><p>This statement suggests that Carla was not necessarily distinguishing between addition in Z and addition in Z 3 and that 0 being the identity was a global property. Both of these issues are discussed further below. Here I wish to suggest that students also had a sense that the 0 in Z 3 is the same as the 0 in Z. This point brings into question the practice of calling the elements of Z 3 the integers 0, 1, and 2. The alternative is to construct Z 3 as equivalence classes in Z so that the elements of Z 3 are subsets of Z and 0, 1, and 2 are but convenient representative elements. When using representative elements to name equivalence classes, some texts use a bar over the representative element, as in 2, so as to distinguish the equivalence classes from elements themselves (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Bhattacharya, Jain, &amp; Nagpaul, 1986)</ref>. This approach might solve the problem of failing to distinguish between 0 in Z and 0 in Z 3 but might also create a different collection of conceptual and notational issues.</p><p>In addition to natural facility with identities called 0 and 1, the students also developed facility with calling the identity e. When groups were given by tables with elements named by letters, Diane and Lori seemed to prefer that the identity be called e and hesitated when the identity was called something else. Yet they also seemed to know that the names of the elements do not matter. I asked them whether it mattered that the identity was called e.</p><p>422 Diane: That's just convention. I mean we could make it i if we want it to be and just say i is the identity. That's just conventional.</p><p>423 Lori: When we renamed and reordered, we looked at the table after we renamed and reordered. We said, "Okay, what acts like the identity?" And that's what we have to set equal to the identity so that we make sure we get back one of our tables. <ref type="table" target="#tab_30">(Interview 2)</ref> Whatever names were given to elements in a group, most students were able to notice when elements acted like the identity even when the elements were themselves sets, such as in a group consisting of two elements, {1, 3} and {5, 7}. In this group, Wendy called {1, 3} the "identity set." Often this sort of reasoning seemed to arise out of the operation table, but the students also were aware of distinguishing characteristics of the identity.</p><p>Wendy, for example, noted on her midterm exam, "The only element that when multiplied by itself, gets itself is the identity element."</p><p>Expectations about inverses. In some representations, particularly when the representations looked like integers, the students sometimes drew on their experience with integers and rational numbers and expected inverses to be negative numbers or fractions, depending upon the operation. Carla, for example, suggested that "the inverse of 2 mod 3 would be 1/2 mod 3, and 1/2 is not an integer, and it is not in mod 3. And the only elements of mod 3 are 0, 1, 2" (Interview 1, line 118). Similarly, Wendy stated that "multiplication is not a group, because there's no inverse … because they're, under multiplication they're going to be, like a fraction" (Interview 3, lines 36-38). In his first interview, Robert expected multiplicative inverses to be fractions and also expected additive inverses to be negative: "Like 1 + -1 will equal 0, so -1 is 1's inverse, but -1 isn't in Z 6 " (line 22).</p><p>This phenomenon of expecting negatives and fractions for inverses is analogous to expecting that 0 is the identity for any operation called addition and 1 is the identity for any operation called multiplication. In the case of the identity, this phenomenon rarely caused difficulty because 0 and 1 often continue to behave as they do in the integers. In the case of inverses, however, the tendency is potentially more problematic because, for [laughs] But any power, any number to the power of 1 <ref type="bibr">[0]</ref> is going to equal 1, which is the multiplicative identity, not inverse. Right? [inaudible] multiplicative identity. So, alpha to the 0 is going, in cycle notation, has to be the cycle identity, which is the do-nothing cycle, which is 1.</p><p>Wendy was able to correct her language, though not without a struggle. Other students also sometimes mixed up identity and inverse and corrected themselves. Lori, for example, said, "Under multiplication there's no identity. I am sorry; there's no inverse for 0" (Interview 1, line 71). Similarly, when discussing {0, 3} in Z 6 , Robert noted, "3 was its own identity. Was its own inverse, I should say" (Interview 1, line 232). He also sometimes used confused syntax, such as, "3 plus itself is an inverse. 3 is an inverse of itself" (line 189). And sometimes the syntax for the inverse was more appropriate for the identity, such as, when discussing Z 3 , he concluded, "So now I find it has an inverse"</p><p>(Interview 1, line 114). Moments later, however, he was clearer: "Let me say that again, the whole group has an identity 0, and each element in the group, 0, 1 and 2, have an inverse" (line 116).</p><p>The confusion between identity and inverse is probably best explained by the close procedural relationships between the concepts. In particular, finding the inverse of an element necessarily involves the identity. As mentioned above, when operations are presented through tables, finding the inverse of an element involves looking for the identity in the appropriate row or column. More generally, checking whether a binary operation satisfies the inverse property is a matter of checking every row and column.</p><p>Robert was explicit about this procedure: "0 doesn't appear in every row and column, so not every element has an inverse" (Interview 1, line 93). The idea of looking for or creating an identity in order to find an inverse leads to procedures in other mathematical contexts as well. For example, a standard method of finding the inverse of a matrix involves performing row operations on an augmented matrix until part of that matrix looks like the identity.</p><p>Another reason for the strong connection between identity and inverse is that it seems to be natural for students to think in terms of inverse pairs, such as {1, 5} in Z 6 , or in terms of triples that include the identity, as is described for Wendy above and for Robert below.</p><p>In this kind of reasoning, elements that are their own inverses are something of a special case that becomes particularly salient when working with operation tables.</p><p>Several students noticed that an identity occurs in the diagonal when an element is its own inverse. For example, Carla demonstrated this connection when she described how she knew that a particular table was a group:</p><p>394 Carla: So if we rename {1, 3} to e, the set {1, 3} as e and the set {5, 7} as a, we will create a table that looks like e along the diagonal that goes like this and a along the opposite diagonal, which is a group because that's…. Well, for one thing it is one of the tables we came up with when we talked about possible groups for a two element set. And for another thing, we see that each of the elements appears only once in each row or column, which tells us it's group. And we see that it contains the identity, that a is its own inverse, e is its own inverse. So, we're all set. <ref type="table">(Interview 3)</ref> As is discussed in the section on Wendy and isomorphism below, Wendy discriminated among groups of order 4 according to the appearance of the identity element along the diagonal. Diane and Lori took longer than Wendy to notice this discriminating feature, but their description makes clear this fundamental connection between identity and inverse.</p><p>394 Diane: All the elements squared is e. Each element is its own inverse.</p><p>397 Lori: They are all their own inverses. Assuming that e is the identity under multiplication, Diane was saying, "If a × a = e then a is its own inverse." By calling this a definition, Diane was either trivializing her own reasoning or demonstrating that she did not distinguish this statement from the definition, which might instead be given by "If a × b = e then b is the inverse of a."</p><p>The connection between the identity and inverse became even more apparent when the students looked for the inverse of the identity. As Carla remarked, "The identity's inverse is itself" (Interview 4, line 133). This observation helped her verify that a group containing only the identity was indeed a group.</p><p>In summary, although the students often confused the terms identity and inverse in their language, they often corrected that language on their own. The frequent confusion between the terms is explained by procedural connections between the concepts. In particular, using an operation table to find an inverse is really a matter of looking for the identity element in the table. The confusion is further explained by the fact that the students thought in terms of inverse pairs, for which the product is the identity. Elements that are their own inverses form a special case when thinking about inverse pairs, and the identity element is always its own inverse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Closure</head><p>The students' concept images of closure were similar to those of other group axioms in that the students' reasoning was often tied to operation tables. On the other hand, the students' concept images of closure were different in that there seemed to be fewer linguistic and conceptual confusions. Closure became prominent in service of the concept of subgroup, both in determining whether a subset was a subgroup and in constructing subgroups of a given group. A firm understanding of the concept of closure also relied on distinctions between operations, such as between addition and addition modulo 6. Because all of these issues are treated in detail in the section on the concept of subgroup, here I make only two observations. First, the students' formal definitions were usually correct. For example, on her final exam Wendy stated that a group must satisfy the property of closure: "For all a and b in G, a * b is also in G." Informal characterizations were quite close to the formal definition. Lori, for example, wrote on her final exam, "So pick any two elements in S, namely a and b and operate them together to see if the answer is in S."</p><p>Second, operation tables helped the students see whether or not closure was satisfied.</p><p>Lori, who had taken the course previously, explained in her first interview that tables helped her understand the concept: "I don't think that I necessarily understood the concept of closed until we made charts and tables and stuff, and we never made tables last semester" (Interview 1, line 5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>More on Subgroups</head><p>The students' concept images of subgroup were dominated by the idea that a subgroup is a subset that is a group in its own right. The students often did not explicitly mention the operation and often made no distinctions between various related operations. These themes characterized the students' formal and informal definitions of subgroup, as well as the ways they solved problems involving the concept. In reasoning about subgroups, the students relied on operation tables, on thinking about the processes underlying the operation, and on considering each of the group axioms individually.</p><p>After providing the students' formal and informal definitions of subgroup, the bulk of this section presents an analysis and synthesis of students' responses to the question, "Is Z 3 a subgroup of Z 6 ?" Results of similar questions on the final exam are also presented. The section continues with discussion of two central phenomena that arose during these interviews: the sense that a subgroup should be a block within an operation table and the belief that addition in Z 3 , addition in Z 6 , and addition in Z are all essentially the same operation. The section closes with analysis of the ways that the students looked for subgroups of Z 6 and, more generally, how they constructed subgroups generated by elements of groups.</p><p>Definitions. On the final exam, the students' definitions mostly characterized a subgroup as a subset that is a group, and the operation was not always mentioned. Robert's definition was typical: "A subgroup is a subset of elements from a larger group G, which form a group under G's operation." Some students did not state explicitly that the subgroup would be a group but rather listed the four group axioms as conditions that the subset must satisfy. Some students mentioned that it was not necessary to check associativity. These formal definitions were consistent with the students' informal definitions found throughout the data. What varied was the kind of attention they gave to the operation.</p><p>Is Z 3 a Subgroup of Z 6 ? When considering whether Z 3 is a subgroup of Z 6 , most of the key participants were seduced by the fact that Z 3 is a subset that is a group in its own right. Carla, for example, after verifying that Z 3 is a group, concluded that Z 3 is a subgroup of Z 6 "because Z 3 is a subset of Z 6 . That is what makes it a subgroup of Z 6 "</p><p>(line 173). Robert, Lori, and Diane came to similar conclusions. Wendy was alone in her early conviction that it did not make sense to consider Z 3 separately from Z 6 . For most students, overcoming this initial conclusion required a coordination of resources and depended upon concluding that addition mod 3 and addition mod 6 are different operations.</p><p>As the students continued to ponder the question at hand, the operation tables and the processes behind the operations created suspicions that Z 3 is not a subgroup of Z 6 , but the suspicions were usually not sufficient to convince them of that fact. Instead, the notion that a subgroup is a "subset that is a group" was strong enough to create the simultaneous belief that Z 3 ought to be a subgroup. This belief may explain the fact that the students had a strong sense that "addition is addition" despite differences between addition mod 6 and addition mod 3.</p><p>Diane and Lori, for example, knew that a subgroup must use the same operation as the group and also saw the operations in Z 3 and Z 6 as different, but that was not sufficient to lead them to a conclusion.</p><p>103 Diane: They are both modular arithmetic, they are both modular addition, they are just different mods. So it's kind of weird what you would think of mods, if you are talking…. If you take into consideration the different mods here and still consider it the same operation, then these could be subgroups. This could be a subgroup of this. But you are saying that this and this are different, then you have say they are different operations.</p><p>104 Lori: Do we define mod 3 under addition a different operation than mod 6?</p><p>Diane and Lori also considered the operation table for the subset {0, 1, 2} in Z 6 , which</p><p>Diane said "would definitely be a subgroup" (line 105   Thus, Diane and Lori had at least two kinds of evidence that the operations are different.</p><p>Despite this evidence, Lori still wanted Z 3 to be a subgroup of Z 6 . She enumerated the group axioms to support her point of view:</p><p>118 Lori: I think it is a subgroup of Z 6 under addition because, kind of like…. We were on a roll here with these things, these being, they're both closed, they both have an identity, they both have inverses, they both are associative, so that makes them both groups, and this is in here.</p><p>Diane was a bit more skeptical. She was still willing to consider Z 3 to be a subgroup of Z 6 but only if "dividing by 3 and dividing by 6 [is] just a characteristic of mod and you are going to say that it's all right to kind of ignore that" (line 122). In other words, she was unwilling to conclude that Z 3 a subgroup of Z 6 without confirmation that "all mod is fine" (line 124).</p><p>Soon thereafter, Lori and Diane went back to considering the tables:</p><p>131 Lori: Yeah, that's what I was saying because when I think of something being a subgroup of something else, its table can almost fit right into it since it's the same operation, and I don't see this anywhere down here.</p><p>132 Lori: I don't think they are subgroups of each other anymore. I was getting confused with …</p><p>133 Diane: I say no.</p><p>Thus, no simple piece of evidence was sufficient, but rather an accumulation of evidence and consideration was necessary for Diane and Lori to conclude that Z 3 is not a subgroup of Z 6 .</p><p>Robert was similarly hesitant to come to the same conclusion even in the face of evidence. He first used the table for Z 6 to show convincingly that the subset Z 3 was not a subgroup because the inverse and closure properties failed. Nonetheless, he went on to create a separate table for Z 3 , and on the basis that Z 3 was a group concluded that it was a subgroup of Z 6 . He was unsure whether to call the operations different: "Are we talking addition mod 6 and addition mod 3, or are we just talking addition?" (line 148).</p><p>Interestingly, Robert was also the only student who was unable to resolve the issue by the end of the first interview. This fact may be partly explained by Robert's sources of authority for making mathematical claims. At the beginning of the second interview, he announced that he had determined that Z 3 is not a subgroup of Z 6 , because the operation is not the same. "For one thing, I read it in the textbook last night. And, for a second thing, Steve told me that today. He mentioned that in class" (Robert 2, line 12). Thus, Robert required evidence, consideration, and external authority to come to the correct conclusion.</p><p>For some of the key participants, the conclusions they reached during their first interview Subgroups of Z and Z n . The prominence of the idea of subset in the students' definitions of subgroup explained not only the sense in which the students considered Z 3 to be a subgroup of Z 6 but also the sense in which they considered them both subgroups of Z.</p><p>Lori, for example, asserted, "Z 3 is a subgroup of Z. We all agree on that, right? So if they are both subgroups of Z, then maybe they are subgroups of each other" (line 142).</p><p>What was harder to explain, however, was Diane's belief that although "Z 3 isn't a subgroup of Z 6 , it's at least a subgroup of Z n , and we know that Z n is a group under addition" (line 44). From the first half of Diane's claim, it is clear that she did not mean that Z 3 is a subgroup of Z n for any n. What is puzzling, then, is what kind of object Z n was for Diane and in what sense Z 3 could be a subgroup. Clearly, Z n was not an unspecified group that could be Z 3 , Z 6 , or any of a number of other groups. Instead, Z n was a different group, distinct from Z 3 and Z 6 , but somehow situated so that Z 3 could be a subgroup. Unfortunately, I did not pursue this unusual idea further in the interview.</p><p>Diane's final exam indicates, however, that, at least at the end of the course, her conception of Z n was more typical.</p><p>Z n : Is a group under modular addition. n is a positive integer and tells which mod we are in and which elements are contained in the group (0, …, n -1 When the students used operation tables, they sometimes paid too much attention to the order in which elements were listed in the table and too little attention to the binary operation underlying the tables. This phenomenon may be related to the strong sense that a subgroup is a subset that is a group, coupled with an overly limited Groups-Are- Containers metaphor that made it difficult for the students to think about nonconsecutive subsets. Nonetheless, the tables served a useful purpose in organizing calculations when the students were constructing subgroups or verifying that a set was a group or subgroup.</p><p>Addition is addition. This study supports the finding in the literature that students sometimes do not pay sufficient attention to the group operation ( .</p><p>The above analysis shows, however, that even when they do pay attention to the operation, there is still a tendency to say that two operations are the same if they are both called addition, and there is reason to believe that analogous results would hold for operations called multiplication.  suggest that students' progress from thinking of groups and subgroups as sets, to considering them as sets with operations, to considering a subgroup as having the same operation as the group in which it sits. This developmental progression makes good sense and partially describes the data in this study. A key question that emerged in this study is, What is involved in making the second transition?</p><p>Dubinsky et al. suggest that students need to consider the binary operation to be a function on ordered pairs from the group and then restrict the function to the subset.</p><p>Then students recognize that the operations need to be the same on the group and the subgroup by coordinating their function concept with their emerging group concept.</p><p>This description, quite simply, does not fit the data in this study. First, there was no indication that the students thought of binary operations as functions. Moreover, there is no reason to believe that such a conception was necessary for success, as many students seemed to be successful without it. Regarding the sameness of the operations, all the key participants recognized that the operations needed to be the same, though not always immediately. The issue was that many of the students were willing to call operations the same despite evidence that they were different. All the key participants saw-by looking at operation tables, by considering the processes underlying the operations, or both-that the operations are in Z 3 and Z 6 are different. Nonetheless, they all concluded at various times that the operations are the same because they are both addition.</p><p>The issue concerns making distinctions, not only between addition in Z 3 and in Z 6 but also with addition in Z. The above analysis suggests that making such distinctions requires coordination of evidence and careful reasoning. Furthermore, even after such distinctions have been made, they can become blurred in students' minds moments, days, or weeks later. These findings should not be surprising in view of the fact that addition in Z 3 , Z 6 , and Z are very much the same. This sense of sameness is not a misconception that must be overcome. On the contrary, this naïve idea, although incorrect, has a grain of truth that can be firmly established only through the concept of quotient group, which is introduced much later.</p><p>Constructing subgroups. In constructing subgroups, the students reasoned both from the table and from thinking about the operation. They typically began with a small number of elements and then constructed an operation table to determine whether the elements constituted a subgroup. Most participants stated, either immediately or while reasoning during the process, that any subgroup must contain 0. Robert, for example, chose {0, 2, 4} and {0, 1, 5} as possible subgroups because "0 has to be in there. And we need things  In other words, beginning with the identity and the generators, they constructed a table and filled in its interior. Then they expanded the table, when necessary, adding a row and column corresponding to each new element that appeared in the interior of the table.</p><p>They continued this process until there were no new elements to append to the table.</p><p>This process is entirely legitimate for any finite group and with any number of generators. Furthermore, whenever the process stops, the resulting set is necessarily a subgroup.</p><p>In summary, the students used operation tables, reasoning about the operations, and the identity, closure, and inverse properties when constructing subgroups. Not surprisingly, associativity was not a consideration. It is legitimate, of course, to assume associativity when the operation considered on the subset is the same as the operation on the set as a whole, but often that was not the case.</p><p>Summary. The students' concept images of subgroup may be characterized as subsets that are groups. Their reasoning about subgroups was dominated by the identity and inverse, closure properties, as embodied in operation tables, and without sufficient attention to distinguishing among various operations called addition. For most students, overcoming this tendency "addition is addition" required multiple sources of evidence, including, for example, operation tables as well as careful reasoning about the operation.</p><p>Regarding the main interview question, these data provide additional insight into the finding in the literature that students believe Z 3 is a subgroup of Z 6 . There seems to be a strong belief that Z 3 should be a subgroup of Z 6 and, similarly, that they are both subgroups of Z, because they are subsets that are groups of their own right. Furthermore, this belief is strong enough to overpower any suspicion that the operations should be acknowledged as different. As for the inappropriate use of Lagrange's theorem to establish that Z 3 is a subgroup of Z 6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Hazzan &amp; Leron, 1996)</ref>, the data and analysis suggest that this phenomenon may not be a matter of confusing a theorem with a converse but rather a matter of grasping a seemingly relevant theorem to support a previously held conviction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Isomorphisms</head><p>Isomorphism was the theme of the second interviews, but Robert's and Carla's second interviews focused on other topics. Nonetheless, the concept of isomorphism arose in interviews with all the key participants, thereby providing sufficiently broad data. Again this section begins with a conceptual analysis followed by detailed analysis of Wendy's second interview, which was particularly rich, and where, once again, the themes are use of language and use of the operation table. The discussion then is broadened to include other students.</p><p>It is through the concept of isomorphism that students begin to gain a sense of abstract groups. Thus, this discussion provides a way then to discuss students' concepts of groups and the nature and role of abstraction in such conceptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptual Analysis</head><p>As discussed above, Wendy noticed during her first interview that sometimes a group's operation This can happen, of course, only when the groups have the same structure, because, once again, it is the operation that gives a group its structure, and the names of the elements are structurally unimportant. When two groups have the same structure, they may be considered "essentially the same," and the groups are said to be isomorphic.</p><p>Furthermore, both groups may be seen as instantiations of the same abstract group.</p><p>It is a hard problem, in general, to determine whether two groups are isomorphic, although it is often possible to see quickly that they are not, such as when they do not have the same number of elements. When two groups are represented by operation tables and if one believes that the two groups might be isomorphic, the naïve approach is to attempt to rename the elements of one group and perhaps reorder the elements in the <ref type="table" target="#tab_76">operation table until the table is identical to the table for</ref>  Dr. Benson and I had as a goal for this course that students would begin to develop an understanding of such abstract groups, so that they might begin to "see" an abstract group "through" a representation. Once again, the only access to abstract objects is through representations or, more to the point, through multiple representations. An abstract object emerges in a student's thinking when he or she begins to see a symbol as a representation rather than a thing-in-itself, but that is unlikely to happen "unless there are other symbols that can be regarded as signifying the same entity" (Sfard, 2000, p. 79).</p><p>For small finite groups, an obvious mode of representation is an operation table. Thus, to pave the way for these ideas in class, the students had been asked on the take-home portion of the first midterm exam (Appendix B) to "fill out all possible operation tables which make the set {e, a, b, c} a group," where e was assumed to be the identity. The  To provide additional grounding for the concept of isomorphism and the ideas behind it, the class spent several days renaming and reordering tables to show that they were the same as other tables. For groups with four elements, they were asked to determine whether they got one of the four operation tables they had identified on the midterm exam (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 11</ref>) and, if so, which one. Our hope was that, when asked to show that Z 4 , for example, was isomorphic to one of these four tables, the students would choose different ones, and indeed they did. Then when one student showed that Z 4 was isomorphic to <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref> in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 11</ref> and another student showed that Z 4 was isomorphic to During this work in class, a student had suggested the word congruent to describe the relationship between two groups that could be made the same via renaming and reordering elements in the operation table. This term suggests the intuitive idea that establishing a correspondence between elements of two groups and comparing the operations is, in a way, analogous to establishing a correspondence between vertices of two geometric figures and then comparing the figures. Dr. Benson introduced the word isomorphic to give a standard name to the naïve concept of congruence that was emerging in the class, and he indicated that the term congruent would be acceptable as well. At the same time, he gave formal definitions of isomorphism and homomorphism (see chapter 6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Wendy and Isomorphisms</head><p>Wendy's second interview took place just after the session in which Dr. Benson had introduced the term isomorphic. I had planned to discuss the concept of isomorphism in the context of the several groups of order 4 that the class had been investigating. I was getting ready to ask a question when Wendy put forward her own question: <ref type="bibr">11</ref> It is possible to formalize this kind of reasoning by proving that isomorphic is an equivalence relation, but this would have required a formal version of isomorphism, which had not been introduced yet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>10</head><p>Wendy: What exactly does the word isomorphic mean? Iso-meaning like, one? Does it mean one?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>11</head><p>Brad: Well, the etymology of the word, iso-means "same." Wendy: Okay.</p><p>[inaudible] I don't like using a word if I don't know what it means.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>17</head><p>Brad: Right. But on the other hand, understanding what the word means, "same form" and understanding how it relates to this stuff here, that's …</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>18</head><p>Wendy: It really relates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>22</head><p>Wendy: Because you can reorder…. The way I explained it to the class today…. I am kind of getting a hold on this.</p><p>[Laughs] (Wendy 2)</p><p>Dr. Benson's introduction of the term isomorphic apparently had not been enough for Wendy. Her initial confusion followed by her response "It really relates" seems to indicate that my description of the etymology of the word was both necessary and sufficient for her to attach the word isomorphic to the idea that she had been developing.</p><p>As is shown below, however, understanding isomorphic as "same form" was not really sufficient.</p><p>Wendy then described how she was thinking about the reordering (rearranging) process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>24</head><p>Wendy: Well, the way that I do it…. Because people have…. One person in class kept on putting up, asking a question that didn't make much sense to me, but I explained my way of saying, well, say we have <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1 and Table 2</ref> [see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 11</ref>], which we kept on saying were the same.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>26</head><p>Wendy: Okay? And we wanted to show that 2,  <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Tables 1  through 3</ref>], two elements equal the identity e, and two elements don't. That's why these three can be arranged to look like each other. <ref type="table" target="#tab_30">(Wendy 2)</ref> So, for Wendy, the differences in the diagonals indicated a fundamental difference between the groups that the tables represented. Furthermore, she saw that the appearance of the diagonal constrained the ways that one table could be rearranged to look like another.</p><p>It is worth noting that Wendy's approach is correct and insightful: The squares-in particular the number of them and how often they each appear-provide essential information (in the sense of "essence") about the structure of a group. In the case of groups of order 4, merely counting the number of squares is an accurate and efficient discriminant between the two groups of order 4. The approach is somewhat general in that if the number and multiplicity of the squares is different between two groups, then the groups are not isomorphic, although the inverse is not always true.</p><p>At this point, Wendy had a sense that the groups presented by <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Tables 1 through 3 were</ref> isomorphic. But actually showing they are isomorphic requires finding an isomorphism, which for Wendy was a reordering and renaming that would make the tables identical, or as Wendy said, "in the same form." Wendy's language in the statement "you want to get it in the same form" <ref type="table">(line 34)</ref> suggests that, for her, the form depended on the arrangement of the elements in the table.</p><p>Rearranging a table would put it into a different form, and the goal was to get two tables into the same form, "hence being isomorphic." Wendy's concept of isomorphism was dominated, at this point at least, by her notion of same form. Thus, her concept of isomorphism depended on the particular arrangement of elements in the table.</p><p>Wendy used the table not only to determine which groups could be rearranged to be the same but also to determine how to accomplish a reordering that would work. By focusing on the fact that the two middle elements in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref> (a and b) had nonidentity squares and the fact that a 2 = e in <ref type="table" target="#tab_30">Table 2</ref>, she knew that something other than a in <ref type="table" target="#tab_30">Table   2</ref> must map to a in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>. One way to accomplish that was by switching a and c, but</p><p>Wendy saw there were other possibilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>41</head><p>Wendy: But if you look at this table, e, b, c, a works, and that is because you can take out a, the a row on this table and slide it up. And that way the diagonal would be e, a, a and if you place a down at the bottom, if you kind of take it out, slide these up and put it back on the bottom you'd get e, b, c, a and that works too. You can do it that way. So there are two ways to do it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>43</head><p>Wendy: e, b, c, a works, and so does e, c, b, a.</p><p>Wendy's explanations were partly based on manipulations of the table, such as switching rows and removing a row and sliding others up. Her written work from class demonstrates the e, b, c, a reordering and renaming process (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 12</ref>). She reordered <ref type="table" target="#tab_30">Table 2</ref> and then used a "renaming function" in order to end up with names that were easier to compare with <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2 is like Table 1</ref> </p></div>

She also had begun to ask more general questions and to sense possibilities for broader conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>47</head><p>Wendy: We can do it more than one way. And that was interesting for me. But what he <ref type="bibr">[Dr. Benson]</ref> was saying today that I really haven't thought much about was that all you have to show, to show that they are isomorphic, is one way, and that makes sense. You don't have to show all of the different ways that it's isomorphic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>48</head><p>Wendy: But, I wonder how many different <ref type="bibr">[inaudible]</ref> ways. Like, say you have <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, which has a, b, or e, b, e, b in the diagonal, and you want it to look like the first one. I wonder how many different ways to reorder it before you rename there are. You know, like, there were two ways to reorder 2 to look like 1 before you rename it. I wonder how many there are for 3. I don't know.</p><p>Thus, Wendy was concerned not only about whether a table could be rearranged and renamed to be the same as another table but also about the number of ways that it could be done, despite the fact that Dr. Benson had indicated that this was not necessary in showing that two groups are isomorphic. Wendy's question demonstrates noteworthy mathematical instinct, for finding and counting the different ways to reorder and rename a group is the key idea behind the set of automorphisms of a group-a topic that we did not explore in class.</p><p>As the interview continued, I asked Wendy to write out operation tables for two familiar groups to see whether they were the same. In particular, I wanted her to compare the rotations in D 4 and a group the class came to call the military group, which consisted of the commands "stand as you are," "left," "right," and "about face," abbreviated S, L, R, A, where the operation was following the first command by the second. I was interested in how she would approach this task because, from a certain perspective, these groups are obviously isomorphic, in that the former consists of rotational symmetries of a square and the latter consists of the same rotations of a person as viewed from above.</p><p>Before I told her the two groups I had in mind, she was concerned that she was going to have to think of the examples. And even when I named two groups, she preferred to copy the table from her notes rather than reconstruct it, suggesting that her reasoning was largely external and based in the </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>61</head><p>Wendy: Yeah, and that is going to make a difference to how you are going to have to rearrange it to make it look like something else. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>+ 0 1 2 3 0 0 1 2 3 1 1 2 3 0 2 2 3 0 1 3 3 0 1 2 1 2</head><p>Wendy noticed the connection while working in the table, not by reasoning about the rotations or addition modulo n or abstractly about the groups. This point becomes clearer as the excerpt progresses. She noticed how the elements rotated and moved up one position in the interior of the table (line 66). Furthermore, her surprise in line 70</p><p>indicates that it was not until she was carrying out this rotation process to construct the addition table for {0, 1, 2, 3} that she realized that the operation was not addition, but addition mod 4.</p><p>To get some clarity on her thinking, I asked her why she switched to addition mod 4. Thus, for Wendy the form was the table, a perspective that may have made it difficult for her to separate the notion of isomorphism from the particular table (and its arrangement) used to represent a group. She had a sense that there was something that stayed the same under rearrangement, but she did not yet have the language for it.</p><p>As the interview continued, Wendy reaffirmed that her key to whether two tables were in the same form was first to look at the diagonals, and her goal was to try to get the diagonals to look the same. I asked her to do that with the military group, to try to make its diagonal look like the diagonal of the rotations in D 4 .</p><p>101 Wendy: Well, I see that rotation 0 is the identity in this table, and it goes…. In this diagonal, I am going to try to set this diagonal up to look like this diagonal and see if everything else will fall into place. In here it's identity, rotation 180, identity, and rotation 180. So am going to see, since S is the identity in this table, I am going to see if I can get the same thing: the first and third squared elements to equal the identity. Like here it's the second. So I am going to try to see if I switch A and L, if I can make the tables look the same.</p><p>As Wendy tried to carry out this plan, she stumbled for a moment because she tried to switch the row and the columns at the same time but then completed the rearrangement ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 11</ref>, <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). </p><formula xml:id="formula_7">R 0 R 90 R 180 R 270 R 0 R 0 R 90 R 180 R 270 R 90 R 90 R 180 R 270 R 0 R 180 R 180 R 270 R 0 R 90 R 270 R 270 R 0 R 90 R 180 * S A L R S S A L R A A S R L L L R A S R R L S A 1 2 * S L A R S S L A R L L A R S A A R S L R R S L A 3</formula></div>

Throughout this process, she paid careful attention to the diagonals, frequently checking the correspondence along the diagonals and often filling out the diagonal of the table first.</p><p>Her process began by making each calculation and then each translation, but as she continued, the process became increasingly abbreviated. She also introduced a function f to describe the renaming from <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> to <ref type="table">Table 4:</ref> 116 Wendy: I am saying that there is a function almost that puts this table to this table. And I am going to call that function…. And the function brings S…. Let's call it the renaming function, and it puts S to E, L to A, A to B and R to C. And what I realized as I was filling up this table, that when, if you have S times L for instance it is going to equal L, and instead of figuring out…. All you have to do is look at the function of L, which is A, to figure out, to rename it, to this … I asked her to explain how this function helped her abbreviate the procedure:</p><p>124 Wendy: So the function that we're calling the renaming function is up here. So R brings, R is renamed to C. So almost f(R) is going to equal C. So that's why I was just saying R is going to be equal to C.</p><p>It took Wendy a long time to say this, and she had trouble articulating the way that the function supported the sense of equality between the groups. In particular, saying "almost f(R) = C" is redundant, whereas saying "R = C" omits the role of the function entirely. A more accurate description would be "almost R = C." The function establishes the "almost" precisely: f(R) = C.</p><p>She completed her calculations and described the result: So the operation and the table are independent of the arrangement and they take form in particular arrangements of the table. The permutation "takes form into account" by specifying the necessary rearrangement to get tables into the same form.</p><p>I asked Wendy whether the groups represented by the tables in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 13</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 14</ref> were all the same.</p><p>138 Wendy: Yeah, they are the same because you can rearrange them to be the same. They are definitely the same. But when you have it, if you have the original military one, the original, and this is D 4 , they are different…. These <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">[Tables 1 and 2</ref>] are in different forms of the same, what would you call it, the same group. Like it has the same…. Or actually, I don't know how you'd say it. They have the same form. They are iso-…. I don't really know…. I have to make this…. I think this is going to be the…. Once I make this statement right here I'll totally understand what I am doing.</p><p>Wendy saw that many of the groups of order 4 were essentially the same. As she tried to describe this, however, her use of language evolved from "different forms of the same,"</p><p>to "same group," to "same form." She almost said "isomorphic" but held back and instead revealed personal insights about the relationship between her language and her understanding. Perhaps she had a sense that the word isomorphic should be about the group and not about the particular order in which the elements are listed. In any case, this seems to have been a significant moment, for her attention turned from the processes of renaming and reordering to resolving her language difficulties.</p><p>139 Wendy: What I am trying to understand right now is whether or not these have the same form, or if these have the same form <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">[Tables 1 and 2 versus Tables 1 and 3</ref>]. Can you say that these two have the same form, or can you say that these two have the same form? 'Cause I understand that these two <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">[Tables 1 and 2]</ref> are the same tables once you rearrange it and rename it, but without rearranging it and renaming it, do they have the same form? They don't. Well, they do because you can rearrange it to have the same form. But I just don't know if you can say that when they're not the same yet. Wendy saw that <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Tables 1 and 3</ref> had the same form, demonstrating that that the form (and hence the abstract group) was independent of the names of the elements. She was conflicted, however, as to whether the arrangement of the elements determined the form.</p><p>She saw renaming and reordering as different processes with different consequences.</p><p>Renaming left the form intact, whereas reordering seemed to change the form. Wendy was uncomfortable with this point of view, however, perhaps because she had a sense that the order in which elements were listed in a table ought to be unimportant. The distinction between the form of the group and the form of the table was helpful to Wendy. At this point it seems as though she wanted the phrase same form to be tied to the group but not to the particular arrangement in the She considered using the words isomorphic and congruent but eventually stuck to the word form. Thus, by the end of this episode Wendy had a firm conviction that there are two groups of order 4. A glance back at the beginning of the interview reveals, however, that she already had a sense of this when the interview started. What had she learned during the interview? She had changed her use of the word form so that it was no longer tied to the particular arrangement of elements in the table, but it is hard to point to any other learning.</p><p>During the interview, the word isomorphic had not been very helpful to Wendy, although it seems likely that she would still say that isomorphic means "same form." She preferred to use the word form, perhaps because neither the terms isomorphic nor isomorphism provide appropriate syntax for what she saw as the essential idea. When one says that two groups are isomorphic, what is it, then, that the two groups have in common? The answer is something like "their essence" or "their form" or "their structure." The term isomorphic is not necessarily helpful.</p><p>During this interview, Wendy was simultaneously developing concepts of the two abstract groups of order 4 and developing language to talk about them. This process involved separating her concept of the groups from the names of the elements and also from the order in which elements were listed in the table. She spent most of the interview generalizing her use of the word form to accommodate this abstraction. It appears that these processes can take a good deal of time and mental effort.</p><p>Mathematical habits of mind. The most prominent feature of Wendy's second interview is that she had noticed a profound mathematical idea: There are essentially two groups of order 4. During this interview, she had a sense that this idea was separate from the names and arrangement of the elements in the tables, but her reasoning was so tied to the tables that she had trouble making the separation. Furthermore, she was going a step beyond this observation and in doing so adopted an inherently mathematical point of view. She</p><p>wanted to know what question to ask in order to get the answer, "There are two groups of order 4." In other words, she not only saw the mathematical elegance of this statement, she also wanted to be able to talk about it.</p><p>In retrospect, perhaps I should have been more helpful in her struggle, for it is highly unlikely that Wendy would have been able to phrase the question in anything like the conventional mathematical way: "Up to isomorphism, how many groups of order 4 are there?" (see <ref type="bibr">Fraleigh, 1989, p. 112;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hungerford, 1974, pp. 76, 82)</ref>. The subtlety and difficulty in the idea are perhaps underscored by the fact that the phrase "up to isomorphism" is not an obvious metaphor. difficulties. In a later interview, she noted, "If you operate any two-cycle groups that don't equal the identity, it is going to equal a three-cycle" (Wendy 4, line 481), demonstrating seed of a good idea here: In S 3 , the product of any two (distinct) two-cycles is a three-cycle. Furthermore, the observation generalizes to S n , although it is necessary to add the hypothesis that the two-cycles overlap.</p><p>Habits of mind such as these ought to be cultivated. They might be missed, however, in a traditional class that does not encourage students to articulate their nascent ideas. From the ways that students are typically assessed and from the ways that mathematics texts are written, the implicit message is that in mathematics what is valued is the result of thinking, not the process of thinking. The case of Wendy suggests the potential of changing the message.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Students and Isomorphisms</head><p>As described above, the concept of isomorphism was introduced informally as a process of renaming and reordering operation tables, and the formal version was introduced later.</p><p>The interviews and the students' exams together provide evidence that the connection between the formal and informal conceptions was not made very well. The students in general had a good intuitive sense of when two groups were isomorphic, though they were often drawn to other language, such as "similar," "corresponding," "the same as,"</p><p>"equal," and, particularly, "congruent." Their concept images were dominated by patterns and relationships they saw in operation tables and in renaming processes, which they were sometimes also able to imagine without operation tables. The formal concept definition, in contrast, was rarely evoked. In a nutshell, the students demonstrated shallow understanding of "isomorphism" as a function with particular properties but rich understanding of "isomorphic," including the ability to see two different operation tables as being the same abstract group. To illustrate this result, I describe below the definitions the students provided on their final exams and the ways in which they used the operation tables to support their informal understandings.</p><p>Definitions. On their final exams, the students' definitions of isomorphism were not very close to the formal definitions that had been provided in class. In particular, although</p><p>Carla and Robert noted that an isomorphism is a function, none of the key participants explicitly included a condition such as f(a*b) = f(a)*′f(b). Instead, most students gave approximate informal definitions of isomorphic, using phrases such as "congruent" and "renaming and reordering." Lori's definition was the least formal:</p><p>f) isomorphism Two groups are isomorphic to each other, if the groups are similar or congruent. This means that there are two totally different groups that can be renamed and possibly reordered to be represented exactly the same. The two groups have the same number of elements, they have an identity element that acts similarily and they have elements that have similar inverses. In other words, the two groups are completely congruent after renaming and reordering.</p><p>Robert's definition, in contrast, was essentially correct, although different from what had been presented in class:</p><p>f) An isomorphism is a special kind of homomorphism. It is a 1-1 and onto function. Things that are the same after renaming and reordering are said to be isomorphic to each other. Note: a homomorphism does not need to be 1-1.</p><p>In class, the concept of homomorphism had been introduced as a generalization of the formal version of isomorphism. Robert had reversed the relationship, making possible a very simple definition of isomorphism. Furthermore, his definition combined formal and informal descriptions clearly and correctly. In fairness, all key participants except Lori provided answers elsewhere that suggest they knew that an isomorphism is a one-to-one and onto function that is a homomorphism. Only Robert demonstrated such clarity when asked to provide a definition of isomorphism.</p><p>Renaming and reordering. The act of rearranging the table was procedurally difficult to carry out and fraught with possibilities for error. For example, it was tempting to try to reorder the columns and rows at the same time without coordinating the two. Renaming and reordering were particularly difficult when the two sets of names overlapped. To overcome this difficulty, some students preferred to rename both groups to some neutral representation, although this approach brought the new difficulty of determining which element "acted like the identity."</p><p>Renaming sometimes presented conceptual difficulties as well. I asked Robert, for example, whether he could rename the {0, 2, 4}  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 15</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>97</head><p>Carla: So if we rename {1, 3} to e, the set {1, 3} as e, and the set {5, 7} as a, we will create a table that looks like e along the diagonal that goes like this, and a along the opposite diagonal, which is a group because that's…. Well, for one thing it is one of the tables we came up with when we talked about possible groups for a two element set. And for another thing, we see that each of the elements appears only once in each row or column, which tells us it's a group. And we see that it contains the identity, that a is its own inverse, e is its own inverse. From the way Carla discussed the diagonals, it appears that she was noticing visual patterns in the tables. When she noticed these patterns, she did not use the word</p><p>isomorphic, yet when I asked her what was the relationship between the first two tables in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 15</ref>, she responded immediately and firmly, "They are isomorphic…. Yeah.</p><p>Congruent" (lines 118, 120).</p><p>For Wendy, the diagonal of an operation table was a distinguishing feature in groups of order 4. The diagonal was particularly salient for other students, as well, particularly when it contained only the identity element. Carla was momentarily convinced, for example, that a group of order 3 should have the identity along the main diagonal, which is impossible for a group of order 3, although it is necessary for groups of order 2 and works for one of the two possible groups of order 4. 14 <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Carla's use of the phrase "the left coset" is explored in detail in chapter 6. 14 These statements assume that elements are listed along the rows in the same order as along the columns.</p><p>Diane noticed similar relationships in her fourth interview, pointing out that two groups were isomorphic to the group she called e, a. At the end of the interview, as she gathered her papers, she looked at two operation tables and said, "Oh, wait, wait, wait. These are isomorphic!" (line 551). When I asked her to think also about Z 2 , she asserted, "It has only one possible table for all groups with 2 elements…. So anything of order 2 will be isomorphic to each other" (lines 561, 563). Thus, Diane had begun to develop a concept of the abstract group of order 2.</p><p>Robert naturally renamed group elements to representations that were more familiar, and he did this even in his first interview, before there had been any explicit attention to the idea of renaming. For example, while he was considering whether {0, 3} is a subgroup of Z 6 , he noted in passing that "You couldn't call it Z 2 " (line 189). Because his comment suggested he saw a connection, I asked him what Z 2 looks like. When I pursued this connection again later, he disagreed that the subgroup {0, 3} was "like" Z 2 . Instead, it had reminded him of Z 2 only because it had two elements (lines 220-225).</p><p>Robert also eventually renamed the table for the subgroup {0, 2, 4} in Z 6 as {0, 1, 2} and noticed that the table was then the same as Z 3 . The process led him to a more general conclusion: The abstract group. The fact that several students used the {e, a} group as a canonical representation of a group with two elements conflicts with my suggestion that that the metaphor "Z 3 is the abstract group with three elements" <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Lakoff &amp; Núñez, 2000</ref>, chapter 3) is backwards. For these students it may be that they were noticing isomorphisms not with the abstract group with two elements but with the {e, a} group.</p><p>In order to notice an isomorphism, however, they must have had some notion of the abstract group, yet it is possible that what they were seeing was patterns in the table rather than the abstract group.</p><p>On the one hand, using {e, a} as the canonical representation of the two-element group makes perfect sense because then the letters can be anything. One could argue that the letters are the names of the elements, but some students saw the letters as variables that can take on any "values." On the other hand, the representation {e, a} does not provide any support for thinking about the underlying binary operation. In fact, it is hard to imagine an underlying mechanism that would give meaning to an operation on elements that themselves seem to carry no meaning. In contrast, Z 2 , as {0, 1}, brings plenty of meaning for the operation. In fact, Z 2 brings so much baggage from operations on integers that it is hard to think of {0, 1} as representing something else.</p><p>Another explanation is that it may be easier to see (and remember?) {e, a} as an object.</p><p>Diane demonstrated this possibility by calling the group "e, a, a, e," listing all the entries in the interior of the table (Interview 4, line 559). The table clearly supported object conceptions, for the students thought of it as something that could be acted on as a whole, compared as a whole with something else, and manipulated as a whole (via renaming and reordering) in ways that do not change its fundamental nature.</p><p>Comparing this result to the findings about the concept binary operation reveals a contradiction. On the one hand, Dr. Benson and I introduced diamond to represent a generic (particular but unspecified) operation, intending that it would stand for any operation. We found that the students saw it as a new operation, distinct from whatever addition and multiplication might make sense on the set. Yet, on the other hand, we also introduced a new group on the letters {e, a}, notationally distinct from familiar groups, in hopes that students might notice that it is "essentially the same" as some of those familiar groups. We found that students treated it, in a sense, as a generic group, capable of representing any of a number of specific groups.</p><p>So who is right? What is the difference between a generic object in a category and a new unfamiliar object in that category? Are the two cases different? In the case of the abstract group with 2 elements, is there a way to represent it generically? Is it better to consider Z 2 or {e, a} as the canonical representation of the abstract group with 2 elements? The data and analysis above suggest that it might be most profitable to imagine the abstract group with 2 elements as something that lies in a coordination between Z 2 and {e, a}. That way, both process and object conceptions are supported, and, more importantly, neither representation is seen as the group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>The students developed rich, nuanced, and largely informal concept images of isomorphism, based on processes of renaming and reordering operation tables. They used operation tables to see when two groups were isomorphic and to construct isomorphisms. These processes supported the emergence of concepts of abstract groups, independent of the names of the elements and the order that elements were listed in the operation tables. Through these experiences, students came to see that there is one group of order 2, one group of order 3, and two groups of order 4. These results suggest that the operation table provides a viable experiential root for the concept of isomorphism.</p><p>Students had considerable difficulty, however, articulating formal versions of the concept of isomorphism. No doubt, this result stems partly from the manner in which the concepts were introduced (first informally, then formally), but it seems unlikely that it would be productive to introduce the formal definition without having developed some sense of what was being formalized. Thus, the pedagogical problem is what might be done to help students connect these informal understandings with the formal version.</p><p>Among the concepts investigated in this study, the concept of isomorphism is perhaps the most striking example of the general problems of connecting formal and informal conceptions, learning to use quantifiers, and learning to reason from definitions. I return to these issues in the chapter 8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Groups and Abstraction</head><p>Most of the analysis above discusses the students' understandings of the groups Z n and groups given via operation tables. As was mentioned in chapter 4, the students in this class also had experiences with U n , D n , S n , as well as other standard and nonstandard examples. There were less data on the students' understanding of these classes of groups than on Z n . Nonetheless, there were sufficient data to support a few observations.</p><p>Regarding the groups U n , the observations are similar to what was detailed above about the groups Z n . The students had a tendency to view the elements of U n as though they are integers, whereas a more sophisticated point of view is that they are equivalence classes of integers, or that they are merely arbitrary names for an abstract group. The students often were not immediately sure of the operation in U n and carried properties of the elements as integers over into U n .</p><p>Students often had trouble writing down the elements of the dihedral groups D <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">3</ref> and D 4</p><p>and were even unsure of how many elements there should be. Robert, for example, described 12 elements of D 4 , not realizing that he had listed 4 elements twice. This was particularly true when the groups were represented as geometric transformations, using letters, such as R 90 for a 90-degree rotation and H for a reflection about a horizontal axis.</p><p>The students also had difficulty when the groups were represented as permutations of the vertices, although, in this case, the difficulty seemed to have more to do with the permutation notation.</p><p>The students took a long time to become comfortable with the cycle notation for permutations in S n and openly expressed frustration early in their learning. Wendy, for The data and analysis suggest that with growing fluency, students' expectations are more often fulfilled, in the sense that they <ref type="table" target="#tab_76">know ahead of time what the operation table ought</ref> to look like, whether a subset is likely to be a subgroup, or whether two groups are isomorphic. This idea makes good theoretical sense and seems to fit the data in this study, although it would be hard to verify empirically because expectations often remain implicit. This observation suggests that the literature on the learning of abstract algebra would benefit from a notion called something like group sense, analogous to number sense ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Greeno, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Markovits &amp; Sowder, 1994)</ref> or symbol sense <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Arcavi, 1994)</ref>, to describe particular kinds of fluency and proficiency that students might develop as they gain familiarity with the examples, notations, language, and results of group theory and the objects and properties that they are supposed to represent.</p><p>The difficulty that the students experienced with the standard examples of groups presents another pedagogical dilemma. On the one hand, abstract algebra is about abstraction, intended to rise above specific examples to see generalizations that apply to whole classes of mathematical systems. On the other hand, the students spent much of their time in this class making sense of specific examples, such as Z 6 and D 3 , and, more generally, classes of examples (Z n , U n , D n , S n ) that were not available to them previously.</p><p>The number systems of school mathematics (natural numbers, integers, rationals, reals, complex numbers) do not seem diverse enough for students to develop rich, robust, and sufficiently abstract concepts of group, subgroup, and isomorphism. Yet if students spend most of the course developing an understanding of these new classes of groups, they are similarly unlikely to develop sufficiently rich and abstract concepts. Dr. Benson solved this dilemma by covering less material than is covered in some abstract algebra courses. What kind of balance makes sense?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main Themes</head><p>In the preceding discussion of the students' concept images of group, isomorphism, and related concepts, two main themes emerge. First, the students' use of language and notation was often imprecise, as they blurred distinctions between closely related signifiers and the ideas they are intended to signify. In particular, the students confused associativity with commutativity and inverse with identity, and they did not distinguish among various operations called addition. Furthermore, although their informal understandings were often rich, the formal definitions they provided often lacked quantifiers and were otherwise imprecise.</p><p>Second, much of students' reasoning and the procedures they used were based in operation tables. Tables served to mediate abstraction in that the students could work with a concrete representation in order to gain access to abstract objects and their properties. Using tables allowed the students to develop procedures for checking the group axioms and for constructing subgroups. They could see isomorphisms from the patterns present in various tables. Tables served a metaphorical role in the sense that thinking about the table helped students think about the group it represented.</p><p>Sometimes the students' reasoning seemed to be largely external and based in the table rather than in thinking about the processes underlying the operations, suggesting that the students' internal representations were rather limited. In such cases, the table often served a metonymic role in that it was the group, rather than a representation. This kind of thinking was limited in that it hindered the students' abilities to see subgroups composed of nonadjacent elements in the tables and to see the operation independent of the order in which elements were listed in the table. As the students gained experience renaming and reordering tables, they began to overcome these limitations by separating the table from the group-the signifier from the signified-thereby developing concepts of abstract groups.</p><p>The theme of language use is an example of a larger issue of making distinctions between related ideas and being precise. The theme of reasoning from the table is an example of the larger idea of managing abstraction. These themes are further developed in the chapters that follow.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HOMOMORPHISMS, COSETS, AND QUOTIENT GROUPS</head><p>The chapter details the students' concept images of homomorphisms, cosets, quotient groups, and related concepts, which were the focus of the third and fourth interviews.</p><p>The organization is by mathematical content. The bottom-up analysis of these interviews revealed a number of themes that are presented in this chapter. The most prominent among these themes was the issue of naming-that is, the relationship between a concept and its name. A related theme was the students' use of notation, particularly regarding the distinction between a set and one of its elements. In several episodes, notational issues were central, and results from these episodes are collected together as a separate section following the section on cosets. Another prominent theme is that the students had developed considerable proficiency with many of the concepts. Their calculations were often guided by correct expectations, they continued to use operation tables to support their thinking, and they were comfortable with many of the processes and objects.</p><p>Because these themes are well illustrated by Carla's interviews, the chapter is based on detailed analyses of her concepts, names, and notations for the topics of homomorphism, coset, and quotient group. The chapter also includes a number of shorter episodes that amplify and clarify some of the issues raised by the analysis of Carla's interviews. In many of these episodes I intervened during the interview, trying to encourage standard language or notation. Thus, the analysis of these episodes provides insights into the learning that is required to make new distinctions and to change one's use of language or notation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Homomorphisms</head><p>The common core of the third interviews consisted of determining whether a particular function was a homomorphism and finding the cosets of its kernel. This section begins with a short analysis of the concept of homomorphism, which is followed by an analysis of Carla's concept of homomorphism. The discussion is then broadened to include other key participants, focusing on their definitions and the manner by which they verified that a function was a homomorphism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptual Analysis</head><p>A homomorphism is a function f from a group G to a group G′, with operations * and *′, respectively, such that for all a and b in G, f(a*b) = f(a)*′f(b). The idea is that the function preserves the group operation (and hence some of the group structure) in the sense that it does not matter whether the operation occurs in G and the result is sent through the function or, alternatively, the elements are sent individually through the function and their images are combined under the operation in G′.</p><p>In the class that provided the context for this study, the concept of homomorphism was introduced as a generalization of the formal version of isomorphism, accomplished by dropping the requirement that the function be one-to-one and onto. An isomorphism completely preserves a group's structure. A homomorphism, in contrast, may preserve some of the structure and collapse the rest. Structure is collapsed by mapping elements in the domain to the identity in the codomain. The set of these elements is called the kernel of the homomorphism. The structure that remains is the range of the homomorphism, which is the image, f(G) = {f(g) | g ∈ G}, of the entire domain. Because such structural relationships may be further explored via the concepts of coset and quotient group, the concept of homomorphism provided some of motivation and context for these more advanced concepts.</p><p>A typical task involving the concept of homomorphism is verifying that a given function is a homomorphism. For the third interview, I chose a function f from U 8 to Z 4 , given by f(1) = 0, f(3) = 0, f(5) = 2, and f <ref type="formula">(7</ref> Although the necessary quantifiers for a and b were not explicit, it became clear later that she intended them to be "arbitrary" (line 16). In saying, "whatever function makes that a group," she may have meant "whatever operation" and merely misspoke. On the other hand, she may have been confusing f with the group operation, a possibility that seems more likely after analyzing more of the interview. I asked her to give an example of a homomorphism.</p><p>8 Carla: Well, we were just talking about in class a few minutes ago, f of Z to Z 4 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>10</head><p>Carla: We know that the integers are a group under addition, so our * is going to be equivalent to adding. And we know that Z 4 is a group under addition mod 4, so we know that *′ is addition mod 4. So if we pick an a and a b in the set of integers-let's say a is 4 and b is 10-then f(a*b) is the same thing as saying f(4 + 10), which equals f(14).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>11</head><p>Carla: So when we find f <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(14)</ref>, because we are going from Z to Z 4 , we want to separate Z into little subsets, to know what maps to what. And we know 4n, where n is an integer, always maps to 0, 4n + 1 maps to 1, 4n + 2 maps to 2, and 4n + 3 maps to 3. So if we look at 14, we can say that that is the same as 4n + 2 where n is 3. So I will just write f(14) as f(4n + 2) just so that…. It's easier to find what that equals. Since it's 4n + 2, it equals 2. So by definition of a homomorphism we should also get 2 when we do 4 of a, I mean, f(a)*′f(b).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>12</head><p>Carla: So that is the same as saying f(4) + (in mod 4) f(10). We can rewrite f(4) as just f(4n) where n is 0, and we can write f(10) as f(4n + 2) because … when n is 2, 4n + 2 is 10, and that helps us to look at which little subset we are dealing with, so we know what it maps to. So f(4n) = 0, when you add mod 4 with f(4n + 2) which equals 2 and 0 + 2 in mod 4 is 2. So we have 2 = 2, and we know it is a homomorphism.  Here she demonstrated a good sense of both the quantifiers in the definition of homomorphism and also what would be involved in proving that the function f was a homomorphism.</p><p>I then asked Carla to describe the relationship between her function from Z to Z 4 and f(x) = x mod 4, as it had been defined in class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>19</head><p>Carla: f(x) = x mod 4 is just telling you that you are going to change whatever x is to a mod 4, so you are always going to get 0, 1, 2, or 3 for your answer. And when I changed the integer to 4n, 4n + 1, 4n + 2 or 4n + 3, that was just because then I could look at whatever integer I am adding to 4n, and I know what my answer is. This is how I simplify. For me it makes it simpler.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>21</head><p>Carla: Well, if it's small numbers, obviously, I don't have to go through that but…. Or especially if I was trying to disprove something or prove that it's a homomorphism or anything, I would need my 4n, 4n + 1, 4n + 2 or 4n + 3. So, it just makes … I think in explaining it, it just makes it a little bit more understandable … because you are dealing with things in the same kind of context. I next asked Carla to identify the kernel of the homomorphism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>23</head><p>Carla: The kernel is 4n, where n is an integer because any integer, any multiple of 4 is always going to map to 0, and 0 is your identity in Z 4 under addition.</p><p>Because Carla did not write anything to accompany this statement, I have guessed that she meant n rather than N, on the basis of what she had been writing previously. With either interpretation, however, her statement is incorrect. There are at least two ways to correct the statement: "The kernel is the set {4n where n is an integer}," or "The kernel is 4N where N is the set of integers." In any case, Carla was not distinguishing between a set and its individual elements. This issue has arisen several times in the results reported in this chapter and is treated in detail below in the section entitled "Notational Issues."</p><p>To determine whether f was a homomorphism, Carla first listed the elements in the groups and then explained her plan:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>33</head><p>Carla: So first I am going to try an example where I am going to pick two elements that map to the same thing, and then if that isn't a counterexample, I'm going to try two elements that map to different things.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>34</head><p>Carla: So first one is going to be…. I want to show that f of…. Let's see U 8 is a group under … [pause]…. I am trying to think if it is a group under addition or multiplication. But it must be multiplication, because if it was addition then 0 would be in there.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>35</head><p>Brad: Why?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>36</head><p>Carla: Because 0 is the identity for addition. So it must be under multiplication.</p><p>Although Carla was momentarily unsure of the operation in U 8 , she was able to determine the operation quickly by reasoning from the group axioms, demonstrating some proficiency with the groups involved. She then verified the homomorphism property for two specific cases, but rather than have her verify all the cases, I chose to move on.</p><p>I asked Carla to identify the kernel of the homomorphism.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>59</head><p>Brad: How do you write that down?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Students and Homomorphisms</head><p>Almost all the key participants were able to recite a definition of homomorphism and describe the concept in several different ways. Furthermore, they were able to check that the property held for specific elements and were able to use the homomorphism property in proofs of other ideas, although quantifiers were often not explicit. These general observations are elaborated below in a description of students' definitions of homomorphism and the ways that they verified that a particular function was a homomorphism.</p><p>Definitions. In the students' definitions of homomorphism, the equation f(a*b) = f(a)*′f(b) was ever present, but few students were careful to state what a, b, and f were intended to be. In the interviews, the students demonstrated varying degrees of sophistication in their concept images around this central equation. Carla's definition, given above, was nearly complete. In contrast, consider the following responses by other students to the question "What is a homomorphism?" from the third interviews:   Diane: It's a property that we can use for functions and stuff. So if something is a homomorphism, then that means that those elements can follow the rule that it's defined by.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>10</head><p>Brad: And what's the homomorphism rule?</p><p>11</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Diane: That f(a*b) = f(a)*′f(b).</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>12</head><p>Brad: Okay. And what kind of function does f have to be in order …</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>13</head><p>Diane: I think that would be defined later. Like function, it could be any function it wants, but as long as it satisfies this, then it's a homomorphism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4</head><p>Robert: It's a function that takes one group to another group and preserves the group operation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5</head><p>Brad: What do you mean by "preserves the group operation?"  Verifying homomorphisms. In the third interview, all the key participants were given the same function as Carla had been given and were asked to determine whether it was a homomorphism. Like Carla, Wendy verified the property for a few examples, described what would be necessary to prove it in general, and then was comfortable assuming that it was indeed a homomorphism when I suggested that we go on. Diane had considerable difficulty with the verification because of her understanding of functions, as mentioned above. Below I describe the ways that Robert and Lori used the operation table to complete the verification, but first, I provide some general observations.</p><p>While verifying that the function was a homomorphism, the students had minor difficulties, such as arithmetic errors or forgetting to send a*b through f. Mistakes such as these are easy to make, of course, when the elements in the domain and codomain look the same. The students were often able to avoid or overcome such difficulties by relying on their proficiency with the groups involved, much as they paid attention to the names of elements and the group axioms to determine which group they were in. The distinction between * and *′ in the homomorphism equation seemed to support this process.</p><p>Robert was confused at first because he did not "really understand what f is" (line 16).</p><p>After I suggested that he set aside that concern, he was able to try an example. I then asked whether operation tables might help, intending to explore Robert's understanding of a method that had originally been suggested by another student in class. wrong with her previous process and was able to articulate more clearly the intended and procedural differences between the two tables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>The students' concept images of homomorphism were dominated by the equation f(a*b)</p><p>= f(a)*′f(b) and not always with sufficient attention to specifying a, b, f, and the operations. Given a function between groups, they were able to check that the property held for specific pairs of elements and to talk about what would be necessary to verify the property in general. There was the slight cognitive difficulty of keeping track of which group an element was in, but the students often relied on their proficiency with the particular groups to manage this difficulty.</p><p>These results suggest that the concept of homomorphism is particularly susceptible to procedural approaches. Typical tasks involve rule-bound symbol manipulation, but even the nonstandard task used in this study was vulnerable to the creation of procedures that can be misapplied, as Lori demonstrated. The concept of homomorphism itself did not seem to raise many issues that impeded the students' progress with the tasks at hand.</p><p>Instead, issues arose in connection with other concepts, particularly the concept of function. This observation arises again below, because the students' concepts of cosets were sometimes limited by their association with homomorphisms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cosets</head><p>With the concept of coset, the students' concept images blossomed once again with linguistic, notational, and conceptual issues that arose and were sometimes addressed during the interviews. After a brief conceptual analysis below, the stage is set once again by Carla, who demonstrated both considerable proficiency with the concepts and procedures and also nonstandard language and notation. The section continues with analysis of an episode from an interview with Diane and Lori, who demonstrated similar nonstandard language. Finally, the analysis is broadened to include other students.</p><p>Notational issues are elaborated separately in the following section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptual Analysis</head><p>Just as a subgroup provides structural information about a subset of a group, the set of cosets of a subgroup reveals information about how the subgroup fits within the structure of the group as a whole. Through a generalization of modular arithmetic (see chapter 7), the idea is to categorize elements of a group according to their relationship with the subgroup. The categories are called cosets. Realization of the structural power of cosets requires also Lagrange's theorem and the concepts of normality and quotient groups.</p><p>Here I focus only on the concept of coset.</p><p>To simplify the language and notation in the following discussion, I leave the group operation implicit, as in ah, and call the group operation multiplication. The ideas and results hold for a group with any operation via simple translation. This is the power of the abstract concepts of group and binary operation. I in no way intend, however, to trivialize the cognitive requirements in making the translation to a group with an operation that is called something other than multiplication.</p><p>If H is a subgroup of a group G, and a ∈ G, then the left coset of H containing a is defined by the formula aH = {ah | h ∈ H}. Right cosets are defined analogously.</p><p>Computing a particular coset aH requires multiplying a particular value a from the group by each element in H. Computing all the cosets involves completing such calculations for all elements a in the group. Either of these processes may be infinite, and such situations carry the additional requirement of being able to describe the results without actually completing the processes. For finite groups, it turns out that the cosets of a subgroup partition the group into subsets that each have the same number of elements.</p><p>Lagrange's theorem-that the order of a subgroup must divide the order of a (finite)</p><p>group-follows immediately from this result.</p><p>Because the kernel of a homomorphism is always a subgroup of the domain, the definition of coset can be specialized as follows: If K is the kernel of a group below, this specialization of homomorphism was quite salient in the students' thinking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Carla and the Left Coset</head><p>Carla's work with cosets followed immediately from her work with homomorphisms.</p><p>Given the function f from U 8 to Z 4 , given by f(1) = 0, f(3) = 0, f(5) = 2, and f(7) = 2, Carla had identified the kernel of the homomorphism as the set {1, 3}. I moved on to cosets. For Carla, the notation aK evoked the term coset and seems to have supported her reasoning: a is an element that varies through U 8 and K is a set. The individual elements of K required little of her attention, as evidenced by the fact that she did not say or write down intermediate calculations and quickly considered {3, 1} to be the same set as {1, 3}. The lower-level process of iterating through the elements of K was essentially automatic. She computed the other cosets similarly and quickly (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 16</ref>), concluding "So we have two elements in the left coset" (line 70). From the ease with which Carla performed these calculations, it seems that she had a firm understanding of the concept of coset, but her statement "we have two elements in the left coset" was nonstandard syntax, suggesting unusual thinking. I asked her to explain:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>73</head><p>Brad: Two elements in the left coset. What do you mean?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>74</head><p>Carla: Because {1, 3} and {5, 7} are each of, are the two elements that result from aK.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>75</head><p>Brad: Are the two…. They are elements …</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>76</head><p>Carla: Well, they are sets, but if you look at them as one…. If you rename {1, 3} to a and {5, 7} to b then there are two elements in aK.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>77</head><p>Brad: Oh, okay. So you are saying, on the one hand, we can talk about the set of cosets. Does that make sense? <ref type="bibr">[Yup.</ref>] So how many cosets are there?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>78</head><p>Carla: Two.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>79</head><p>Brad: Two. But now does aK refer to the set of cosets, does it refer to all of them, or does it refer to one specific one?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>80</head><p>Carla: aK tells you how you find the cosets. So that was none of your choices. What were your choices?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>81</head><p>Brad: Does aK refer to all of the cosets, or just one of them?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>82</head><p>Carla: aK is the general formula that gives you all of the cosets. Then you choose specific as for whatever K you are given, and you will find all the specific cosets.</p><p>Thus, Carla had an efficient and reliable procedure for computing cosets, and the procedure was supported by the notation aK. Nevertheless, she did not maintain a clear distinction between a single value of a and the set of all of such values, and thus did not distinguish between the particular coset aK and the set of all cosets of K. Instead, a varied as part of a procedure specified by the formula aK, which gave all the cosets.</p><p>Psychologically, it seems to be an easy step to then imagine that aK is all such cosets, without needing to distinguish between a nonspecific one and the collection of all of them.</p><p>Analysis. Carla was happy to let a vary through all the elements of G and to construct the collection of cosets aK that result. What she did not see, however, was a need to distinguish notationally between the particular coset aK and the collection of all such cosets. By calling the cosets elements, Carla appeared to have little difficulty seeing cosets as objects, suggesting that she had encapsulated the process of coset formation.</p><p>Furthermore, her language "the left coset" for the collection of cosets suggests that she had further encapsulated that collection as an object, a set of sets, a point of view that is helpful in order to see the set of cosets as itself a group under the appropriate coset arithmetic. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 17</ref> shows schematically the objects and processes involved in coset computation and delineates the two levels of processes. Carla's language suggests that her thinking was in the transitional process between two objects: the particular coset aK = {ak | k ∈ K} and the set of all cosets of K, which might be written {aK | a ∈ G}. In the midst of the process, a is varying, so aK denotes neither a particular coset nor all of them. For Carla, aK denoted and specified the process. Thus, my question about the distinction (line 81) was not relevant to her.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 17. Objects and processes in coset computation</head><p>A particular a in G The subgroup K Process: By letting k vary through K, calculate all the products ak. Collect them into a set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The coset aK</head><p>Process: By letting a vary through G, calculate all the cosets aK. Collect them into a set.</p><p>The set of all cosets of K Being immersed in the process allowed Carla some flexibility in her thinking. On the one hand, she could consider a particular coset by stopping the process for a moment. On the other hand, she could consider all the cosets by completing or imagining she had completed the process. From within the process she could broaden her viewpoint slightly and see both a particular coset and the set of all of them as two aspects of the concept of "coset." Thus, "aK tells you how to find the cosets," and together there are "two elements in the left coset." Carla maintained this dual role of the term coset through the fourth interview, and even maintained her process orientation, saying, for example, "The left coset gives the set of <ref type="formula">(23)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(132)</ref>" (line 239, emphasis added) rather than the left coset is that set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diane, Lori, and Cosets</head><p>Although Carla's ambiguous use of the word coset was unusual and idiosyncratic, Diane and Lori used similar language. During their fourth interview, I asked them to find the cosets of a subgroup in D 3 . They each drew a triangle and labeled the vertices 1, 2, and 3 to help themselves write down the elements of D 3 . Based on the geometric interpretation, they used the standard term rotation and the nonstandard term flip to distinguish (1), <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(123)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(132)</ref> from <ref type="formula">(23)</ref>, <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(13)</ref>, and (12).</p><p>They had initial difficulties with the coset formation process, first multiplying each element of D 3 by only (12) rather than the whole subgroup, {(1), (12)}. Diane explained, "The cosets are only going to be using the element <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(12)</ref> because <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(1)</ref>  Diane pointed out that they should try the calculation with something other than rotations.</p><p>Before they began those calculations, I asked Lori what she was calling the coset. Thus Lori was at this point clear on the process. Furthermore, she was calling (13)H a coset, but H and (13)H together were "the whole left coset."</p><p>When I asked them how they would write it, they listed the elements in both cosets, but 148 Diane: This is the coset, the left coset, and these are the elements in it.</p><p>They had both then written ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(1)</ref>, <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(123)</ref>, <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(132)</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">(23)</ref>, <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(13)</ref>, <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(12)</ref>). Lori explained: During this passage, Lori was trying to adopt Diane's language, which was to call the set of cosets "the left coset" and to call each of the cosets "elements." Much earlier, when</p><p>Diane had predicted that there would be two cosets, she had called them cosets (line 82).</p><p>But this may have been a slip of the tongue, for other than this single sentence, her distinction between "the left coset" and "elements" was entirely consistent. Lori, on the other hand, seemed to be comfortable with her ambiguous language, and she was also  Diane and Lori agreed that what they had written as ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(1)</ref>, <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(123)</ref>, <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(132)</ref>) was in fact a set. I asked whether they could use braces to call it a set, and they both changed their notation to {{(1), (123), (132)}, {(23), (13), (12)}}. I asked them what that was. Diane said, "A set of sets" (line 196), and Lori agreed. Furthermore, it was a set with two elements, each of which were sets with three elements.</p><p>I asked Diane what she meant by the word coset. She responded, "This whole thing"</p><p>(line 214), pointing to the set of cosets. Lori agreed that she had been using the word coset to describe the individual calculations. But then she backed off: Diane was focusing on the completed process and was not concerned about individual cosets. She later agreed that it would be useful to have a name for the sets H and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(13)</ref>  Diane seemed comfortable with the distinction and with the two options I was putting forward. I continued:</p><p>257 Brad: So it seems to me we just need to decide which of those two approaches to take. Does that kind of…? Am I putting words in your mouth?</p><p>258 Diane: No, no. I know.</p><p>259 Brad: I'm sort of boiling down what the disagreement is.</p><p>260 Lori: Oh, yeah, I definitely see that.</p><p>261 Diane: Yeah, I've been having problems with calling everything the same thing, and I want to separate it.</p><p>So it appears that Diane and Lori saw the distinction I was trying to make. Furthermore,</p><p>Diane made clear that she had been uncomfortable "calling everything the same thing." I again tried to impose standard language. Thus, after emphasizing the crucial distinction between a coset and the set of all of them, I gave them the standard language, and they seemed comfortable with it. It remained to be seen, however, what influence that intervention would have on the language they used.</p><p>We next began talking about right cosets.  349 Lori: And there's going to be two cosets in our whole set. We're just calling this a set <ref type="bibr">[inaudible]</ref> or the left coset.</p><p>Conclusion. This case demonstrates that Carla's unusual language was not so unusual. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Students and Cosets</head><p>In characterizing the concept images of coset for Carla, Diane, and Lori, I found the central issue to clearly be one of language. By broadening the analysis to include other key participants, a conceptual issue rises to prominence: Many students preferred looking for a homomorphism and its kernel before they were willing to compute cosets, suggesting that the concepts of coset and kernel were closely related in the students'</p><p>thinking. Carla, for example, initially thought that to compute cosets she would need the kernel of a homomorphism. Wendy displayed similar expectations, as did Robert in both his third and fourth interviews. This connection is not surprising because, as mentioned above, cosets require a subgroup, and kernels are always subgroups. Nonetheless, the concept images of cosets and kernels were so strongly connected that the students were sometimes obstructed in their progress on the interview tasks.</p><p>In Robert's third interview, I asked him whether he could find cosets of the subgroup generated by 3 in Z 12 . He calculated the subgroup as {0, 3, 6, 9}, called it theta, and then looked for cosets.</p><p>278 Robert: All right, so I've got to find the kernel though of Z 12 in order to get cosets. H is the kernel. Over here it's anything that maps to 0 would be in the kernel … anything in here that maps to 0 in Z 12 .</p><p>Thus, Robert thought he needed to find a kernel. He soon realized that in order to talk about the kernel he needed a homomorphism, which he said would "Take Z 12 to theta"</p><p>(line 284). A good portion of the interview was consumed constructing a mapping and considering whether its kernel was a subgroup and even whether the mapping was a function in his sense of the term.</p><p>Robert's association between coset and kernel presented a significant stumbling block that was preventing me from learning about his concept of coset. Eventually, I</p><p>intervened: Thus, during this interview, with the support of improved proficiency with the concepts and processes, Robert was able more quickly to overcome his association between cosets and kernels.</p><p>In both interviews, Robert demonstrated an insufficiently general concept of coset, suggesting that the students' experiences with cosets of kernels of homomorphisms overpowered the more general tasks. For Robert, overcoming such a constrained concept image of homomorphism seemed to depend on Robert's proficiency with the processes and related concepts. It seems that when a students' concept of coset depends upon having a kernel, it is not easy to generalize to cosets of arbitrary subgroups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>The foregoing analysis characterizing the students' concept images of cosets supports two results. First, the students used nonstandard language, which indicated nonstandard concepts that were dominated by the process of creating the cosets and which failed to distinguish between an individual coset and the set of all of them. Furthermore, the students were resistant to attempts to impose standard language. Second, the students' concept images were insufficiently general and were dependent on their proficiency with the concepts, processes, and examples. Other results about the students' understandings of cosets are presented below. Results concerning the ways the students used notation are presented in the following section. The analysis has already described ways in which the students considered cosets to be objects, but a deeper discussion of the process/object distinction in the students' concept images of cosets must take into account not only these notational issues but also the ways the students used cosets in constructing quotient groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Notational Issues</head><p>There was considerable variation among the key participants in the ways that the notation supported and inhibited their concept of coset and the related processes. Carla's intermediate position in the process between an individual coset and the set of all of them was strongly supported by the notation aK. Diane and Lori, in contrast, did not use such symbolism during their interview but seemed similarly process oriented. In this section, I present three kinds of notational difficulties: confusion between set and element, trouble managing processes, and losing track of the objects. Each of these is illustrated by an episode related to the concept of cosets, but the issues are more general, as is suggested by these descriptors.</p><p>Carla's failure to distinguish between a particular coset and the set of all of them might be characterized more generally as mixing up statements about sets with statements about elements (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Selden &amp; Selden, 1978)</ref>. The characterization that she was immersed in the process is more compelling, however, because there is no indication that Carla was confused. Furthermore, this notion of being stuck in the process can also explain a statement Carla had made earlier in the interview, but which I had not pursued: "The kernel is 4n where n is an integer" (line 23). As mentioned above, whether Carla meant N or n, she was not appropriately distinguishing between a set and one of its elements. A more compelling explanation, however, is that Carla saw 4n as the process for generating the kernel, which might be described as an intermediate position similar to that for her concept of cosets. The subsection entitled "Wendy and N + N" explores almost identical language and notation during another interview.</p><p>The second notational difficulty is related to the set/element distinction but has to do with managing the process of coset formation, thereby providing insight into the relationship between symbolism and processes. During her third interview, Wendy described her coset calculations as follows:</p><p>253 Wendy: It's going to be all the elements times…. Like 1…. All the elements, we are going to call them h. h are all the elements in U 8 . And k are going to be elements in the kernel. So h times {1, 3} is how you are going to find it. So it's going to be 1 times {1, 3}, and it's going to be 3, 5, 7 times {1, 3}.</p><p>To accompany her statement, she wrote h ∈ U 8 and k ∈ K. Neither her words nor these symbols distinguished the different roles played by h and k. Nonetheless, she maintained the appropriate conceptual distinction, for she also wrote h{1, 3} and performed all the calculations correctly. Robert, on the other hand, demonstrated a similar use of notation but had considerable difficulty establishing a sufficient conceptual distinction between the set and the element to manage the processes of coset formation. This is illustrated below in the subsection entitled "Robert and What Varies."  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>53</head><p>Wendy: x is going to be an integer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>54</head><p>Brad: Okay, now is x…? In these 4 cosets, is x a specific integer?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>55</head><p>Wendy: No.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>56</head><p>Brad: What do you mean?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>57</head><p>Wendy: It can be any…. Like any integer you put in here will give you…. Any integer you put in for x will give you 0 … will give you 0 mod 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>58</head><p>Brad: So like you could put in 2 for x. Like Carla, who had used 4n, Wendy was using 4x to denote both a particular multiple of 4 and the set of all of them. My language "a specific integer" did not help her make the distinction I was trying to make. Of course, x was not a specific integer. The question is whether she was imagining that it was a particular integer or the set of all of them. Yet, perhaps even this distinction would not have helped, for she was focusing on the images of these integers in the codomain, Z 4 . And for that purpose, 4x + 1 was going to map to 1 whether it was a particular value or any set of values. The letter N denoted what she had previously called 4x and was "any integer that maps to the identity," which was not specific but "any multiple of 4." Simultaneously, N was a set. Thus, Wendy was not distinguishing between any multiple of 4 and the set of all of them.</p><p>When I mentioned again that the set was infinite, she said, "That is why I was calling it </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>88</head><p>Brad: So then, when you write this thing 4x, you mean this set of all the things together, taken as a whole. Or do you mean individual specific …?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>89</head><p>Wendy: Uh huh. Taken as a whole. Take as a whole.</p><p>So just like N, 4x was simultaneously any multiple of 4 and the set of all of them. From the fact that Wendy used both N and 4x, a glance at her work might have suggested that she was using the standard convention of using capital letters for sets and lowercase letters for individual elements. Wendy was making no such distinction, however. The two notations were identical in meaning.</p><p>I asked what could be done with the cosets. She reaffirmed that "N = 4x, where x is all integers" (line 98) and renamed the other cosets to N + 1, N + 2, and N + 3. She struggled for a moment over whether to add or multiply the cosets but then decided to add them because "integers are only a group under addition" (line 112). Then she tried to calculate N + N and N + (N + 1).</p><p>It seems that Wendy knew that N + N = N and that N + (N + 1) = N + 1. Her reasoning was flawed, however, relying on algebraic procedures that work for symbols that stand for numbers but not symbols that stand for sets. Her symbol manipulation was guided more by her expectations about the results than about the meaning of the symbols.</p><p>I asked her what N + N meant.  148 Wendy: 4y.</p><p>150 Wendy: This is going to be 4xy. So it's still going to be a multiple of 4 and then you add 1. 156 Wendy: Okay, which is the same thing…. So this is still going to be 4 times…. This is still going to be an integer. An integer plus an integer is going to be an integer. So I am going have to call x + y = z so 4z + 1, so this is still going to be N + 1. That's how I can explain this.</p><p>Wendy's reasoning and symbolic representation seemed sound at this point. I then attempted to learn how she had previously been thinking about the symbols.</p><p>158 Brad: Okay. But now here, when you are saying this 4x + 4y, are you imagining that this is one specific x, for now, and this is one specific y, for now?</p><p>161 Wendy: Yeah, but it would work for any x and y.</p><p>162 Brad: Okay. But are you imagining for a minute that they are fixed?</p><p>165 Wendy: It helps me think of it better, but it doesn't necessarily have to be. Because no matter what x or y you put … any integer you put in there, it will work. So, and these are all the integers. x and y are all the integers for … are just, are all integers. So in that case and since it works for all integers, you can look at it as the whole set. But yes, you were right, I was looking <ref type="bibr">[inaudible]</ref>.</p><p>167 Wendy: … But it doesn't make a difference, because…. It did help me clarify at first, but because if you show for a specific case it does work, and then if you take a step back and say it does, it works for every case … like x, no matter what value for integer x, or y, it will still work.</p><p>Thus, Wendy agreed that it helped to think of x and y as fixed, but any integer will work, "and since it works for all integers, you can look at it as the whole set" (line 165). Her thinking could move smoothly from a fixed value, to any value, to all values, and finally to the set of all values without ever a need for a clear distinction. Nonetheless, at this point, she had begun to articulate a distinction in her thinking: first showing that it works for a specific case and then stepping back to see that it works in general.</p><p>I asked her to reflect on possible differences in meaning between 4x and N, and she asserted that "this set and this set are going to be the same" (line 171).</p><p>173 Wendy: I was calling x and y different, but they are not. Because x is going to be all integers. In this set, y are all the integers. Like this is 4z, and this is 4z + 1. This is the set 4z + 1 … all integers …</p><p>174 Brad: By z there you mean …</p><p>175 Wendy: All integers in z.</p><p>Thus, the distinction in Wendy's thinking was not yet reflected in her interpretation of the notation. Wendy's written work through this point included only a single lower case z, but her statement "All integers in z" seems to suggest that she was thinking about the set of integers. Thus, just as Wendy was not distinguishing between a single value of x and the set of all of them, she had not been distinguishing between a single value of z and the set of all of them. After I asked whether she meant the set of integers, however, she changed her notation from what appears to be a lowercase to the capital that is typically used to denote the set of integers (i.e., ). there that x and y, because they are integers, because you took them from the set of integers, x and y will be an integer, so 4…. This is still going to be an integer.</p><p>It seems Wendy was still somewhat uncomfortable about x being a particular value.</p><p>When I asked her to explain the sum 4Z + 4Z, she started talking about the whole set but then resorted to using x and y to illustrate a particular case. I asked whether she was beginning to see a distinction between 4x and 4Z.</p><p>190 Wendy: Uh huh. Yeah. I am a lot more so than I was when I was up here.</p><p>191 Brad: Is that helpful to make that distinction?</p><p>192 Wendy: Yeah. I don't like calling it x now because it does, here looks like a more specific value, except it is not. But I think in a sense I was thinking of it, even though I didn't think I was.</p><p>193 Brad: You were thinking of it in which way before?</p><p>194 Wendy: As a more specific value. Although I knew that I should keep in mind that it was a set, but I think I was still thinking of it too specifically. I think I was right to show … to explain it using a specific example, but I think it was important to go back, to begin and to end, showing that it was the whole set.</p><p>x and y, but I wasn't really thinking of it as a whole, as like a Z, like integers.</p><p>Wendy was seeing a conflict in her earlier work: thinking of x as a specific value while also keeping in mind that it was the whole set. She stated that she had been thinking "too specifically" and had not really been thinking of x as the "whole set." Her language again suggests an intermediate position between a particular element and the set of all of them, because "it works for all values of x and y."</p><p>She began to focus on the notation:</p><p>198 Wendy: For some reason just visually, if you look at this 4x + 2 [points on paper] and 4Z + 2, visually, if you look at the two, it's easier to see one being a set and…. It's easier to see 4Z + 2 being a set over 4x + 2.</p><p>200 Wendy: 4x + 2 looks more like a value than it does a set.</p><p>202 Wendy: But I think it is clearer to write, you know, like Z as, like an upper case Z, like writing the notation as a set for the integers. So 4Z + 2 is going to equal, obviously be a set, and it is not going to be a value.</p><p>203 Brad: So it is useful, then, you think now, to distinguish between those things that are sets and those things which are sort of generic values.</p><p>204 Wendy: Like I use N, an uppercase N here. I think it makes more sense to use like the…. I think…. Do we use uppercase values for sets, rather than lower case?</p><p>So by the end of the interview, Wendy saw that the standard convention of using uppercase letters for sets could be useful in making a conceptual distinction. It seems she had much earlier developed a sense that uppercase letters were usually sets, though perhaps she had never before been in a situation where she felt a need to make a clear distinction between a set and an element.</p><p>Wendy seems to have learned to distinguish between a set and an element. Because this interview took place after the final exam, I can make no claims about the stability or durability of this learning. Instead, I would like to point out what seems to have been required. First, Wendy did not make any distinction between a particular value and the set of all values until she saw that her equation 4x + 4x = 8x did not support the idea that the sum of any two multiples of four would be a multiple of four. Yet even after she began to make the distinction verbally, she still did not make it notationally. And even after she made the distinction notationally, she had to revisit her intermediate conceptual position of something that "works for all values of x." Then, by reflecting on the notation, she was able to see how the notational distinction could support her emerging conceptual distinction. Furthermore, it seems that I provided cognitive support by asking Wendy whether she was imagining x as fixed, suggesting that this metaphor was not available to Wendy at the beginning of the interview.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Robert and What Varies</head><p>Of the key participants, Robert had the most trouble negotiating the processes involved in computing the collection of cosets and, in particular, in keeping track of what kinds of entities he was dealing with and where they were situated. During his third interview, he was working with the same homomorphism as Carla above and had just determined its kernel. I asked him to find the cosets of the kernel.    149 Brad: What do you mean "which side?"</p><p>150 Robert: Where do these as live? Do they live in U 8 or do they live in Z 4 ?</p><p>Robert quickly set down a symbolic definition of coset but did not know what to do with it because he was uncertain as to what H and a represented in the problem at hand. This first uncertainty was quickly resolved, but determining what a was proved to be more problematic. The homomorphism made Robert uncertain about whether a was in the domain or the codomain. Furthermore, his uncertainty was deeper than where a was located; it also involved what kind of entity a was.</p><p>153 Robert: Well, essentially what I would do is I would add 1 to all of the elements in a. I want to think that like a is like the generator of Z 4 or something.</p><p>154 Brad: What do you mean?</p><p>155 Robert: I don't know exactly. Could a just be all of Z 4 ? If a was all of Z 4 .</p><p>156 Brad: What do you mean by "all of Z 4 ?"</p><p>157 Robert: 0, 1, 2, or 3. The set.</p><p>166 Brad: And is a this whole set, or just one of them at a time?</p><p>167 Robert: Well it's just one of them at a time but…. Oh, no, no, it's not. It's the whole set. I think it's the whole set.</p><p>In the first sentence above, Robert talked about "all the elements in a," suggesting that a was a set, but in the second sentence, a denoted a "generator" of Z 4 . The latter statement suggests that Robert may have been considering some intermediate role for a, where it was neither an individual element nor the whole set. But while he considered whether a could be all of Z 4 , I may have pushed him toward the set interpretation by my question, "Is a this whole set, or just one of them at a time?" which implicitly excluded an intermediate role.</p><p>I then tried to encourage him to take advantage of the common notational distinction between a set and its elements, using an uppercase letter for the former and the corresponding lowercase letter for the latter. I pointed out that he was not being consistent:</p><p>168 Brad: Here you have distinguished between big H, which is the set {1, 3}, and little h, which equals 1, I guess, or 3.</p><p>169 Robert: Uh huh. But there is no big A down here. So, a is the whole set. So I would have two cosets. 173 Robert: I am sure that's the way that they define it. Okay. So that would make sense. So, I would have two of them. This one would be 1, 0, 3 …</p><p>Thus, on the one hand, Robert adopted a notational distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters, but on the other hand, he continued to see a as the whole set. In making these computations, Robert took h 1 = 1 and h 2 = 3. He was concerned that the two calculations resulted in the same set, but I chose to focus on the fact that he was adding elements from different groups:</p><p>So Robert decided that the calculations should take place in U 8 , but a remained a set in his thinking. Both of these calculations again resulted in the same set, this time U 8 . I asked him to explain the notation aH = {ah | h ∈ H}.</p><p>194 Robert: Well, they are saying that … this is like the name of the set. And this tells you what all the sets … the set is composed of, ahs such that h is in H. So for all of the as, you operate them with every h in H, and you form a set.</p><p>197 Brad: Now is that what you have done?</p><p>198 Robert: Well, my big question, I guess, is what is a? Yeah, I believe that's what I have done. 1, 3. Yeah here's the hs: 1 and 3 were the only two hs we had. And I guess is a…. I don't know why I think that a is a set.</p><p>205 Brad: So would you write then aH, a big H, is equal to well … [inaudible] how you write it.</p><p>206 Robert: <ref type="bibr">[Laughs.</ref>] a big H is equal to…. This is what, I mean, without doing the calculations, that's what it kind of looks like. But it doesn't seem to make sense to have all of these brackets.</p><p>[Writes aH = { 1{1, 3, 5, 7}, 3{1, 3, 5, 7} }.]</p><p>207 Brad: Okay. But in a sense it looks like aH is a set containing two sets.</p><p>208 Robert: Yes. Even though they are the same set.</p><p>There are two points to make here. First, if a = {1, 3, 5, 7}, then Robert's calculation was correct, as was his notation for it. Second, although he could write appropriate set notation, he did not like "all of these brackets," suggesting that the set notation did not support his thinking. At this point, I asked Robert to consider that a was not the set {1, 3, 5, 7} but instead just one of its elements.</p><p>210 Robert: So you are saying that a would be each individual element. Then we'd have</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ah 1 , ah, … a 1 h 1 , a 2 h 2 … h 1 , a 3 h 1 , a 4 h 1 ; aH. You could pick 1. 1 × 1 = 1. 3 × 1 = 3</formula><p>. This is kind of a trivial one.  Despite my suggestion that a be one of the elements rather than the set, Robert still let a vary through all of U 8 and fixed h to be one element in H. This is similar, perhaps, to the idea he was considering at the beginning of this episode when he suggested that a might be a generator of Z 4 . Both of these ideas-letting a vary through all its possible values and letting it be a "generator"-are, in a sense, intermediate between considering a fixed value and considering the set of all possible values, yet there is no conventional notation for this idea. Furthermore, because Robert's calculations explicitly included only one of the elements in H, it is not clear to what extent he was distinguishing between H and h 1 .</p><p>At this point in the interview, I took a different tack, bringing in an idea that was more familiar: 228 Brad: Now how did you do that?</p><p>229 Robert: Well, H consists of h 1 and h 2 , which are 1 and 3, respectively, and I operated 3 with each one of those things, and I made a set. 3 × 1 is 3 and 3 × 3 is 9, which is 1 mod 8.</p><p>230 Brad: What would 5H be?</p><p>231 Robert: 5H would be 5, 5 × 1, and 15 which is 7, 5H, 5 and 7.</p><p>[Writes 5H = {5, 7}]</p><p>232 Brad: Okay. Now, what you are saying to me then is that this 3 is fixed, but you are letting H do what?</p><p>233 Robert: Go through its possibilities.</p><p>Robert was able to do these more familiar calculations with ease, suggesting that his difficulties were largely notational and arising out of the fact that in aH there are two things that can vary. The notation aH represents a particular but unspecified calculation of which 3H is a specific example. Clearly, Robert had not made this connection. But after I provided supporting language about what was fixed and what was varying in 3H, he was able to describe his previous calculations as fixing h 1 and letting the as vary.</p><p>Then I took advantage of this distinction:</p><p>243 Brad: So I guess there is a choice here, that you can either fix the h 1 and let the as vary, or you can fix the as and let the hs vary.</p><p>244 Robert: Okay, I see what you are saying now. And if you were to … if you let the as vary and fixed the hs you just end up with the same set you had, so that seems, like, inconsequential.</p><p>245 Brad: What if you do it the other way?</p><p>246 Robert: Then you get a bunch of different sets. 4 sets, I don't know what that would be … 3 would be 1H, 3H we have there; 5H; 7H is the only one we don't have. 3 and 5, so I put the 5H, and so we get 1, 2, 3, 4 different sets this way, but really only two different sets.</p><p>247 Brad: What do you mean?</p><p>248 Robert: Well, these two sets are the same, and so are these two sets.</p><p>[Draws a line from 3H = {3, 1} to 1H = {1, 3} and a line from 5H = {5, 7} to 7H = {7, 5}.]</p><p>With my distinction between fixing either the a or the h, Robert was able not only to characterize what he had been doing but also to envision an alternative. At this point he had completed the calculations and had noticed that the four calculations yielded two cosets. To see whether Robert could see the appropriate procedure in the notation, I</p><p>asked him to reflect on the notation:</p><p>254 Brad: Built into this notation, aH is equal to the set ah such that h is in H…. Which do you think is implied by this notation? I said, we can fix the as and let the hs vary, or fix the hs and let the as vary, right?</p><p>255 Robert: It seems to be let the hs vary. I don't know. That notation, a times h such that h is in H. It seems as though you have to let the hs vary. But if a was an individual element in the original group, then you let both of them vary, essentially. See, but there's nothing there that tells you to let a vary, but there is certainly something to tell you to let h vary.</p><p>256 Brad: And yet when you first did this, which one where you letting vary?</p><p>257 Robert: I let the hs vary. Over here. But I considered a to be the whole set.</p><p>258 Brad: As opposed to …</p><p>259 Robert: The big question for me now is, Is a the whole set, or is it the individual element in the set? Which, if a was the individual element in the set, it would mean that a was varying too. But you take each a and operate it with the varying hs versus taking the whole set of a and operating it with the varying hs.</p><p>Thus, despite having completed the correct calculations and being more satisfied with the result of two cosets than he had been previously with the calculations that yielded {1, 3, 5, 7} twice, Robert was still unsure about the interpretation of a in the definition of coset.</p><p>This episode demonstrates that notational distinctions do not necessarily create conceptual distinctions. From a mathematical point of view, the appropriate procedure for computing cosets follows directly from the symbolic definition. In computing the set of all cosets of a subgroup, there are processes and objects at two levels, as described above. At the lower level, h varies, creating a particular aH, which is an object. At the higher level, a varies, creating the set of all cosets aH, another object.</p><p>Robert did not see aH as being a description of 3H but instead focused on the fact that a was supposed to vary, thus merging or perhaps inverting the two levels. Robert did not make a clear conceptual distinction between what was fixed and what was varying.</p><p>Neither did he make a notational distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters.</p><p>Furthermore, from Robert's first response above (line 255), it seems that he had previously reflected little on the notation. Thus, it may be that Robert did not distinguish aH from ah or even AH, which would partially explain his merging of the two levels.</p><p>In order to encourage Robert to make the appropriate distinctions, I emphasized conceptual distinctions between sets and elements and between what was fixed and what was varying, and I emphasized notational distinctions between uppercase and lowercase letters. It appears, once again, that both conceptual and notational distinctions need to be emphasized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Carla and aK = bK</head><p>After Carla had completed the core tasks of the third interview, I chose to investigate her understanding of some of the results for which she had given correct proofs on the second 135 Brad: Okay. Now why do you know that?</p><p>136 Carla: 'Cause we did it on the take-home. The definition of aK is that aK, uppercase K, is the same as the set of a lowercase ks such that f…. Actually we wrote this two different ways. It's…. Okay, one way to write it is ak such that k is a member of K, which is actually the kernel. But another way we wrote it was that it is all xs in G such that f(x) = f(a). So if we write bK as that…. If we write the definition of bK, we have bk such that k is a member of K. We'd also have x is a member of G such that f(x) = f(b). If we said that aK = bK, then for the two sets to be equal, f(a) has to equal f(b) because they both equal f(x).</p><p>Carla was almost correct. She first stated the major result from the exam and then presented, as definitions, two descriptions of aK, though she expressed concern a few moments later that something might be missing from one of these definitions. The first definition, aK = {ak | k ∈ K}, is correct and complete, essentially independent of where a and K come from, requiring only that K be a set and that the product ak be defined for each k ∈ K. The second characterization, aK = {x ∈ G | f(x) = f(a)}, on the other hand, was not a definition but an intermediate result from the exam. Furthermore, her explanation that "f(a) has to equal f(b) because they both equal f(x)" ignored the fact that in the second description of aK, and likewise for bK, the variable x was not a particular value but rather was to vary through all possible values for the purpose of finding those that satisfied f(x) = f(a).</p><p>In order to get a sense of the meaning Carla was associating with the symbols, I asked her how she would write an element in aK.</p><p>From this point on, the interview gradually took on a noticeably different character, becoming more directive and less exploratory. More of my questions required short, symbolic answers. During this time, Carla provided shorter answers and focused mostly on manipulating the symbols, similar to the work that she had done on the midterm exam.</p><p>For example, she wrote both z = ak and z = bk (lines 148-150), not realizing that the ks might need to be different. At another point, she attempted to divide (line 179) rather than to multiply by an inverse. Her most surprising statement came after I asked her to verify some of her symbolic results for the particular case of the homomorphism and cosets from earlier in the interview. In response to some difficulty with the symbols, she said:</p><p>209 Carla: See, I don't like this business of multiplying integers times sets. I don't think that is very good.</p><p>210 Brad: Why?</p><p>211 Carla: Just 'cause you don't you usually do it. You usually do sets times sets.</p><p>Clearly at this point in the interview, Carla did not recognize that her earlier calculations of cosets were elements times sets (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 16</ref>). All of these surprising statements, coupled with the fact that Carla did not use the word coset again in the interview (lines 147-246), suggest that she had was not conscious of the fact that aK and bK were intended to represent cosets like those she had computed earlier in the interview.</p><p>Furthermore, she was making no substantive connection between the first and the second half of the interview or, equivalently, between her example-driven procedures for generating cosets and her symbolic calculations related to the proofs on the midterm exam. One possible explanation is a profound compartmentalization between two activities involving the symbol aK. On the one hand, there were activities where aK specified the process for generating cosets, and on the other hand, there were proof activities that involved manipulating symbols such as aK according to certain rules. A less extreme explanation is that she would not have characterized one of the coset calculations in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 16</ref> as an element times a set because she did all such calculations, which might be described as a set times a set. As for her discomfort with multiplying an element times a set, she softened her position the next day: "I don't know why I said that, because I was thinking about it later, and 4Z is an element times a set" (Field notes, May 3, 1996).</p><p>This episode further supports the position that that, for Carla, aK denoted a process if it denoted anything. Despite the fact that the process yielded cosets and a set of cosets that Carla considered to be objects, the notation aK did not denote such objects but was somehow separate from them. This result suggests that at least two encapsulations are required in learning about cosets: one for specific groups and another for reasoning about cosets generically.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>The common theme in the above episodes is that of insufficient connections between notation and thinking. The notations 4x, aH, and aK did not always support a student's thinking even when that thinking was sound. Although Carla, Wendy, and Robert demonstrated different degrees of success with the tasks involving cosets and very different understandings, they were similarly imprecise in their use of the notation. Carla and Wendy, on the one hand, were clear on the concepts and the processes, yet the notation was not strongly connected to their thinking. Robert, on the other hand, was unclear on the concepts and processes and was not able to read the intended processes from the notation aH.</p><p>These episodes suggest an explanation for the problem of distinguishing between a set and an element. What seems to be missing in all of these episodes is the ability to think about generic objects. Reasoning with the notations as 4x and aK as generic representatives of a class of objects seems to require imagining, metaphorically, that x, a, and K are fixed. Then a kind of encapsulation is required to see 4x and aK as denoting particular but unspecified objects-a multiple of 4 and a coset. I say a different kind of encapsulation because there is every indication that the students could conceive of multiples of 4 and cosets as objects, suggesting that something like encapsulation had already occurred.</p><p>These episodes also suggest the hypothesis that proper usage of notational distinctions requires first the creation of a need for a conceptual distinction. The conceptual distinctions and notational distinctions are not automatic, but rather each requires learning. They are neither simultaneous nor consecutive but rather dialectic.</p><p>Furthermore, there is good reason to believe that the metaphors "suppose x is fixed" and "now let x vary" can provide cognitive support for learning to make such distinctions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quotient Groups</head><p>As mentioned above, the set of cosets of a subgroup can reveal structural information about how the subgroup fits within the structure of the group as a whole. Thus, given a collection of cosets, a guiding question is whether those cosets can form a group-a quotient group. This section characterizes the students' concept images of quotient groups. It begins with a conceptual analysis that details the relationships among the concepts of subgroup, coset, homomorphism, normality, and quotient group, describing important aspects of the students' curricular experiences regarding these concepts. The majority of the section consists of a detailed analysis of Carla's concept of quotient group, based largely on interviews in which she again demonstrated unusual language alongside well-established concepts and procedures. The analysis is then broadened to include other students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptual Analysis</head><p>A quotient group or a factor group is a group whose elements are cosets and whose operation is given by extending a group's operation to its cosets. Assuming the group's operation is called multiplication, the product of two cosets involves multiplying, in the appropriate order, all possible pairs of elements, one from each coset. Not all cosets can form a group in this way, but when the left cosets of a subgroup are the same as its right cosets, the subgroup is said to be normal, and the cosets will form a group under the set operation described.</p><p>For example, the set of left cosets of {1, 3} in U 8 is {{1, 3}, {5, 7}} (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 16</ref>).</p><p>Because multiplication in U 8 is commutative, the set of right cosets is the same, and thus {1, 3} is a normal subgroup. The product of {1, 3} and {5, 7} is computed as follows:</p><p>{1, 3}×{5, 7} = {1×5, 1×7, 3×5, 3×7} = {5, 7, 7, 5} = {5, 7}, where the products inside the braces are taken to occur in U 8 . All the products of pairs of cosets may be organized in an operation table (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 15)</ref>, where it is possible to see that the cosets form a group with two elements. To analyze the interviews involving quotient groups, it will help to step back from particular objects and processes and consider them more generally. Most of the interviews may be described as instantiations of the general coset activity represented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 19</ref>. How does one make sense of such an activity? What does one take from it? <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 19</ref> serves not only as a representation of an activity but also as an analytical tool constructed to investigate these questions. It supports semiotic analysis by distinguishing the processes from the names and the symbols from the objects in order to discern meaning. Thus, making productive sense of a coset activity requires distinguishing among the various components in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 19</ref> and then assigning names appropriately.</p><p>The standard description of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 19</ref> is as follows: Given a group G and a subgroup H, the left cosets of H are calculated and collected. The cosets are then considered elements in a new structure, a set of cosets. Coset products are computed, and results may be organized in an operation table. Carrying out theses two processes requires some conceptual flexibility: first conceiving of a set or an element as fixed and letting other sets or elements vary, and then letting the fixed set or element vary to carry out the higher processes. Managing such a process, after all, was precisely the problem Robert had in computing cosets, as described in the subsection entitled "Robert and What Varies."</p><p>If the set of (left) cosets constitutes a group under this operation of coset multiplication, then the set of cosets is called a quotient group. The construction depends upon both the group and the subgroup. Thus, the resulting group is called the quotient of H in G, denoted G/H and read "G modulo H." Of course, the set of (left) cosets does not always constitute a group, and the arrow is dotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 19</ref> to indicate this potentiality. It turns out that the key issue is one of closure: whether the product of two cosets is again a coset. When this criterion is satisfied, all the other axioms follow: In G/H, the identity element is the coset H; the inverse of the coset aH is the coset a -1 H; and associativity follows from the associativity of the operation in G. It turns out that equality of left and right cosets is both a necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee that the product of two cosets will be a coset. In other words, the cosets of a subgroup form a group precisely when the subgroup is normal.</p><p>Independent of whether the subgroup is normal, and thus even when set of cosets does not form a group, structural information is provided via Lagrange's theorem, which says, once again, that the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group. An immediate corollary is that the number of cosets is the missing divisor. In other words, if H is a subgroup of G, then |H| divides |G|, and the number of cosets of H is given by |G|/|H|. There is an obvious symbolic similarity with the notation for the quotient group, G/H. The similarity is significant, in that the elements of G/H are precisely the cosets, which implies that |G/H| = |G|/|H|. This equation provides obvious potential for confusion. On the right side, the slash denotes a quotient of natural numbers, whereas on the left, the slash denotes a quotient group. Furthermore, this equation is true in the completely different but familiar context of high school algebra. If G and H are real numbers with H ≠ 0, then the equation is an identity for the absolute value function, whose notation is that same as that for the order of a group. This analogy may reinforce students' common but mistaken impression that</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">G/H is division.</formula><p>At about the time of the third and fourth interviews, the students had been investigating cosets of subgroups and cosets of kernels of homomorphisms. The guiding question, which built upon the students' early work with set arithmetic was, "Is it possible to create a group with these cosets." The students also explored cosets more generally, proving, for example, that the cosets partition a finite group into equal-sized pieces (see "Problems to work on the week of April 22," Appendix B).</p><p>The students also had been investigating relationships between a group and its image under a homomorphism. Given a group homomorphism f: G → G′, the students investigated of elements in the range of the homomorphism, which turn out to be cosets of its kernel. This fact follows from the proof on the second midterm exam that f(a) = f(b) if and only if aK = bK, where K is the kernel of the homomorphism. The f −1 students considered the operation table of the range of f and the operation table for of each element in the range (see "Notes on cosets, April 29," Appendix A). It turns out the two groups are isomorphic. This is the essence of the first isomorphism theorem, which says that the structure of the image of a homomorphism is identical to the structure of the cosets of its kernel.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">f −1</formula><p>Preceding all of the fourth interviews and some of the third interviews, Dr. Benson had introduced Lagrange's theorem and the term quotient group to give standard names to ideas that had emerged from the students' work on these kinds of tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Carla and the Normal Group</head><p>During Carla's third interview, she computed the cosets {1, 3} and {5, 7} in U 8 . I asked her whether she could use these cosets to form a group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>85</head><p>Carla: Well, let's see…. We will create a table with {1, 3} and {5, 7}, of course, on the top and on the right. Actually, we talked about this in class. If we know that the right coset is equivalent to the left coset, then it does create a group. I think it's called a normal group, and these will…. I think we will have a group because I think that the right coset equals the left coset, because it really doesn't matter if you multiply on the right or on the left.</p><p>Citing results from class, Carla was convinced that the set would be a group because, as she correctly observed, the left and right cosets were the same. She was essentially correct, except for her use of the words coset and normal. I have already discussed her use of the word coset to denote a set of cosets. As for her use of the word normal, it seems she had lost track of the subgroup that gave rise to the cosets and was applying the word to the quotient group rather than to the subgroup. Furthermore, her left coset and normal group both named the same set of cosets, suggesting that the set of cosets was a very salient object for her.</p><p>Carla completed the coset products easily and quickly, taking advantage of the commutativity of the underlying group and organizing them in a table (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 15</ref>).</p><p>From the table, she noticed almost immediately that the group was isomorphic to the group on the set {e, a}, where e is the identity. Later she saw that it was also isomorphic to the range of the homomorphism, which was the subgroup {0, 2} in Z 4 , as detailed in chapter 5.</p><p>Carla had participated in an activity depicted structurally in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 19</ref> and had created written records similar to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 15</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 16</ref>. She admirably negotiated the various kinds of processes involved in the activity and seems to have had a good sense about the kinds of entities (e.g., sets or elements) she was dealing with. On the other hand, Carla seems to have attached the names coset and normal to the objects and processes in nonstandard ways. This hypothesis is further explored in a detailed analysis of her fourth interview.</p><p>Cosets in Z 12 . Carla's fourth interview concentrated on examples and nonexamples of quotient groups, which required computing cosets and paying attention to whether the left and right cosets were equal. When I mentioned to her, as a preface to the interview, that we would be discussing quotient groups, she showed discomfort:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">6</formula><p>Carla: I have got to figure out what they are. Quotient group…. This is one of the things I haven't…. I've needed to study it, but I haven't done it yet.</p><p>[Okay] What is the other name for a quotient group, that we gave? It wasn't a normal group right, that's different.</p><p>Thus, although Carla had computed a quotient group in the previous interview, she had not yet attached the name to the idea. I suggested we start with an example and return to the term later.</p><p>To get started, I asked Carla to find the subgroup generated by 3 in the group Z 12 . She was momentarily confused about the operation in Z 12 but quickly resolved that issue and soon determined that the subgroup generated by 3 was {0, 3, 6, 9}. I asked her to find the cosets of that subgroup.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>22</head><p>Carla: Okay. First we will do left cosets. Probably the left coset and the right coset will be the same, but we'll start with the left coset. So, do you want me just to use the kernel as the …</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>23</head><p>Brad: Do it whatever way you think is best.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>24</head><p>Carla: Well, I'll start with the kernel at least because I am most comfortable with that.</p><p>The kernel is 0 because 0 goes to 0. 0 is the identity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>25</head><p>Brad: You said 0 goes to 0. What does 1 go to?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>26</head><p>Carla: No. 1 is not in there.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>27</head><p>Brad: Oh. Okay. So what does 3 go to?</p><p>28 Carla: I don't think…. We haven't really…. Well, we know 0 goes to 0 because the identity always goes to the identity in two groups. But we haven't really defined what the others <ref type="bibr">[inaudible]</ref>. The other, you know, function that we are dealing with <ref type="bibr">[inaudible]</ref>. I am doing it with 0 and that's it … because I know I can do it with the kernel because the kernel is…. Oh, wait a sec-. We do cosets…. We have to have a subgroup. And we have to perform an operation of the members in Z 12 on the left, for the left coset. So you have members of Z 12 * with the subgroup. And I already know what the subgroup is, so it's 0, 3, 6, 9. Took me a while, but … Carla momentarily thought that she needed a kernel to talk about cosets but then reasoned that only a subgroup was necessary. It seems from line 22 that she was still using the term "left coset" for the set of cosets, just as she had in the third interview.</p><p>Carla called the subgroup S and listed the elements of Z 12 . In describing how she knew the operation was addition mod 12, she talked at first about a group G′, suggesting she had not completely abandoned the idea that there was a homomorphism involved. Then she went on. with S" (line 41). Soon she stopped doing the calculations directly and instead reasoned about the results, based on a pattern.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>43</head><p>Carla: So we can see that there is a pattern here. 0 and 3 have the same left coset. And so 6 will and 9 will, because they are all multiples of three, because I can see a pattern of 3 here. So 1, the left coset, containing 1 is 1, 4, 7, 10. And that is the same as the left coset containing 4. So 1, 4, 7, and 10 are going to have the same left coset. So then it will be 2, 5, 8, and 11 that will have the same left coset.</p><p>The results of her calculations are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 20</ref>. At first she had not recorded an operation in some places, such as between 2 and S, but when I asked her about the notation, she inserted an asterisk (*) and said that it was addition mod 12. Carla went on to compute right cosets. She first listed the calculations she intended to make, and then stopped after computing S*0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>55</head><p>Carla: And right away I see that the right coset is going to the same thing as the left coset because we are adding mod 12 and it's commutative. So it doesn't matter which side your single element is that changes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>57</head><p>Carla: So we have a normal group because…. I think it's a normal group that says that the left coset equals the right coset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>58</head><p>Brad: So what is the normal group here? When we have the left cosets and the right cosets being the same we have this thing called normal, but I want to know precisely what is normal here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>59</head><p>Carla: So the normal group is a set of sets. So one of the smaller sets will be 0, 3, 6, 9.</p><p>[Okay.] Another of the sets will be 1, 4, 7, 10. [Okay.] Another one will be 2, 5, 8, and 11. So our normal group consists of three sets.</p><p>Two points are to be made here. First, Carla did this work with little interaction from me, and she noticed quickly that right coset calculations would yield the same result as the left coset calculations she had just completed. Second, her usage of the terms coset and normal group was consistent with her usage in the third interview. For Carla, the construction of the normal group required that the left coset equal the right coset. When I asked in what sense it was a group, she began by stating that the identity would be {0, 3, 6, 9}. To explain this, she decided to construct a table ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 21</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>81</head><p>Carla: Now I think that the middle spot in the table is going to give me 0, 3, 6, 9. So I am going to…. Well, but I can see that it's not going to do that. So then I know that it's going to be 2, 5, 8, 11. The reason that I knew it wasn't going to do that is because I saw 1 + 1 is 2, and that's not in it. So that cancels that right there.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>85</head><p>Carla: Yes, [you should always get another coset in these calculations] with a normal group. And I know that with my 3-by-3 group tables one of the options is to have all of the identities down the diagonal, so that's why I automatically thought that might be the identity in the middle position. But then when I checked it, I realized it wasn't. But it still can be…. I can still have a group table.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>88</head><p>Carla: Since this is a group, I know that every element only appears once in each row or column, so I see that 0, 3, 6, 9 is left, for the second row. And then I can just check that 2 + 1 is 3, 5 + 1 is 6, 8 + 1 is 9, 11 + 1 is 12, which is 0 mod 12.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>92</head><p>Carla: Even if you just see one of the elements, you know which coset it is going to belong to because the cosets don't overlap.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>98</head><p>Carla: It has to contain 3, and that's the only coset that contains 3. So then I have one spot left so I know that has to be 1, 4, 7, 10 because both the third column and the third row lack that set.</p><p>Carla's approach, based on patterns and facts, was reasonably efficient and included some redundancy, which she used to catch errors. She knew every pair of cosets would Exploring the language. Carla had previously stated that the result would be a normal group, but I wanted to get some clarity on how she was using the phrase. When I asked her what the resulting table was and what it had to do with the word normal, she responded that it was a group table that had "everything to do with the word normal"</p><p>(line 102). She continued:</p><p>111 Carla: That's how you know. That's how it differentiates from just any old group.</p><p>So the normal group was a group, as demonstrated by the table, and it was normal because there were left and right cosets that were equal to each other. These associations of the words normal and group are essentially correct. In particular, when the left and right cosets are equal to each other, the word normal applies. But the term is supposed to point back (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 19</ref>) to the subgroup that led to the particular set of cosets not forward to the quotient group.</p><p>I next explored whether Carla could make any connection to the subgroup:   I take this last statement to be Carla's definition of normal group. She recognized that it was the subgroup that led to the cosets but did not see any reason to attach the word normal to the subgroup. Furthermore, she stated moments later that if the left and right cosets of S had not been equal, she would not have gotten a group.</p><p>At this point in the interview, it was clear that Carla had the right ideas but was using the words coset and normal in unconventional ways. I then explored what she would do with the conventional language:</p><p>121 Brad: Does the phrase normal subgroup, would that mean anything?</p><p>122 Carla: My guess would be that a normal subgroup would be a subgroup of a normal group.</p><p>126 Carla: If that's true, then a normal subgroup of this normal group that we are talking about could be this set {0, 3, 6, 9} because that's in the kernel. That is…. Well, actually I am mixing things here. I know it could be 0, 3, 6, 9 because that's just the identity, so it's obviously closed and has its own inverse and …</p><p>In response to my suggestion, Carla held on to her notion of normal group and applied her concept of subgroup to that. As the interview continued, she proposed {0, 3, 6, 9} as a one-element subgroup of her normal group because it was the identity of that group.</p><p>She went on to legitimize this group by noting that there is no "rule against" a one- element group and that the group axioms were satisfied. I then decided to be more explicit about the term quotient group: Carla was willing to accept the term quotient group but was reluctant to let go of her usage of normal group. Despite my direct statement, she at first was still trying to figure out what a quotient group was (line 165) and only gradually came to decide that it was the same as her normal group, though perhaps only in this case. She had not yet detached the term normal group from her previous meaning. My next statement (line 166), however, seems to have caused her to consider a different meaning for normal group.</p><p>As the interview continued, Carla said, "I guess I have a problem with names" (line 171).</p><p>I suggested that the idea was already there and that the issue was sticking a name on it.</p><p>Then I encouraged her to connect the word normal to the subgroup:</p><p>178 Brad: But in order to talk about cosets you need to have what?</p><p>179 Carla: A subgroup.</p><p>180 Brad: Right, so this word normal tells us something about the subgroup that led to those cosets. Now let's see if that can make any sense.</p><p>181 Carla: Maybe it's when the subgroup is the kernel? I don't know. Because that's the only thing that I can think of that we've been talking about that kind of sets the subgroup apart. Like that's the only more specific characteristic of a subgroup that I can think of right now that we have talked about. The other subgroups were just subgroups, but if you have a subgroup that contains only the elements that map to the identity, then that's more specific.</p><p>182 Brad: Okay. But in order to have … 183 Carla: We don't even have a homomorphism here. So, there goes that theory.</p><p>Even when I told her directly that the word normal applied to the subgroup (line 180), Carla was not able to make the appropriate gluing. The suggestion she made about the kernel, it should be mentioned, is correct in principle, in that the kernel of any homomorphism is a normal subgroup and any normal subgroup is kernel of a homomorphism. This is a pretty sophisticated view, however, and one that would ordinarily have required consideration of some major results, such as the first isomorphism theorem, that were not yet available. and she immediately responded that it would be just <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(1)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(12)</ref> Here Carla described two approaches and provided a hint of the extent of the proficiency she had developed both with the group D 3 and with the creation of subgroups more generally. She carried out six coset calculations (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 22</ref>), making one small error that was quickly corrected. She saw that she got only three cosets as a result and suggested that the right cosets would be different because here "the order that you do that in does matter" (line 222). When computing the right cosets, her calculations were guided by expectations that grew from noticing which elements were paired with other elements in the cosets, an approach that implicitly took advantage of the fact that cosets do not overlap. </p></div>

I asked her to try to make an operation table with just the left cosets. Before computing the product of {(1), (12)} and {(23), (123)} she predicted the result would be a "four element thing" (line 246), demonstrating some proficiency with set arithmetic with non-normal subgroups. When her prediction turned out to be correct, she noted, "It's not closed" (line 256), because the product of the two cosets was not another coset.

She called the subgroup S again and computed the left cosets (123)*S and (132)*S quickly (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure   24</ref>), reasoning from the fact that S is closed. For the other cosets, her calculations were  (1)*S = S (123)*S = S (132)*S = S (12)*S = {(12),(23),(13)} (13)*S = {(13),(12),(23)} (23)*S = {(23),(12),(13)} Rt.

She then reflected on the fact that, while order mattered in D 3 , the order did not seem to matter in these coset calculations:</p><p>303 Carla: Right, but we had the right combination of things so that…. Where the order mattered…. Because the elements of the sets can be in any order…. So where the order mattered it covered up for it because you had the right combination of elements.</p><p>314 Carla: Well, we just see that the subgroups in case of the subgroup generated by (12), we didn't have the right combination of elements … or "right" as in to make the cosets equal, the right combination of elements so that they were equal. And in this case we did have the right combination of elements.</p><p>318 Carla: Well, one thing that might have helped us is that this subgroup has more elements in it. So it might cut down on the error.</p><p>Rather than just ascribing the differing results to the original subgroups, Carla looked inside the subgroups to determine what might have caused the results.</p><p>Exploring the language again. Equipped with these additional examples, I pursued the language again:</p><p>320 Brad: Do you suppose we could use the word normal to help us out here?</p><p>321 Carla: [Laughs.] I don't know…. Well, which one is normal? Can you tell me that? I don't, I have no idea what normal is. I thought I knew about it. I have no idea.</p><p>322 Brad: Well, you were saying before that you have a situation kind of called normal when you have left and right cosets being the same, right? You said something like that, didn't you? So where are left and right cosets here?</p><p>323 Carla: Well, left and right cosets are the same here. Maybe it has something to do with their inverses. Because this one (123) and (132) were inverses of each other, whereas in this one each element is its own inverse. That probably didn't answer your question. I was kind of half listening. What was it?</p><p>Carla recognized that she was not sure about the use of the word normal, and she recognized that the two subgroups were somehow different in that one led to left and right cosets that were the same and the other did not. Rather than merely using (and not using) the label normal to distinguish between them, she was looking for something deeper: some differing characteristics of the subgroups that would explain the differences in the cosets. As a result, she did not hear my question, so I repeated it:</p><p>326 Brad: Ah, well now, but what was quotient group?</p><p>327 Carla: Quotient group is one by, the set of cosets where the left and right cosets are equal. I guess.</p><p>This last statement is almost identical to Carla's previous definition of normal group (line 117), suggesting that she had substituted the new name for the old idea. As for the differences between the subgroups, she was still trying to find a reason:</p><p>339 Carla: Well, yeah, but the only thing that I see … the only difference that I really see between, at least right now, between them, is the thing about the inverses. I'm not seeing any other … unless it is just normal because it's generated … [inaudible] doesn't make sense. I don't know. It doesn't…. If a quotient group is the set that you get when, from the cosets, if the left and the right cosets are equal, then maybe the normal group is the group that you use to get the left and right cosets in that case.</p><p>340 Brad: What do you mean?</p><p>341 Carla: Is the normal group the group that is always going to be your S, when you find your left and right cosets in the way we do the quotient group?</p><p>342 Brad: Oh, so you mean the subgroup we started with?</p><p>343 Carla: Yeah.</p><p>351 Carla: So I would say that this subgroup is a normal group. If, well, if my guess is right, this subgroup is a normal group, and that one isn't.</p><p>[She points first to the subgroup {(1), (12)} and then to {(1), (123), (132)}.]</p><p>It seems that at this point in the interview she had at last made the desired connection between the word normal and the subgroup that determined whether the left and right cosets were the same. The only remaining difficulty, it seemed, was that she was calling it a normal group rather than a subgroup.  355 Carla: Well, I would think a subgroup is usually a smaller group. So I would think that a normal subgroup, you have to get that from a quotient group. And that it would have to give you a different quotient group.</p><p>Carla gave meaning to term normal subgroup in a way that indicated that for her the term normal was still strongly connected to the quotient group, maintaining some of its previous meaning. Yet a few moments later, she reconsidered:</p><p>363 Carla: Right. So, well, then maybe we were all … we only talked about normal subgroups and not normal groups. Is that what you're saying? Because I'm fine with calling it a subgroup. I really don't care. Because if you don't really talk about normal groups and you only call them normal subgroups, you're just focusing on the fact that they are subgroups.</p><p>While thinking about the terms used in class, Carla relaxed the tie between the word normal and the quotient group and was willing to consider alternatives. She realized that she may have been remembering the wrong term and that if the correct term was normal subgroup then perhaps it made sense to apply it to the subgroup that led to the cosets. I closed the interview by checking on how she labeled the various objects and the connections among them.   This core activity may be enlarged in two ways. First, the group and the subgroup may be identified as the domain and kernel, respectively, of a homomorphism between two groups. This is similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Fraleigh's (1989)</ref> treatment, in that the concept of quotient group is introduced as the group of cosets of the kernel of a homomorphism. The second way to enlarge the core coset activity is to ask, once the quotient group has been calculated, whether the quotient group is isomorphic to a familiar group. Several students did this naturally on the basis of the patterns in the table, as discussed in chapter 5. These extensions are useful in the analysis because for Carla these extensions were sometimes natural parts of the activity. In particular, in one task she at first wanted the subgroup to be the kernel, demonstrating a connection between the core activity and the concepts of kernel and homomorphism (Carla 4, line 28). And after completing the group table for {1, 3} and {5, 7}, she went on to show, without any prompting from me, that the group was isomorphic to a familiar group with two elements.</p><p>The extensions are also useful for mathematical reasons because the entire diagram can be tied together with the first isomorphism theorem, which says that, given a group homomorphism, the quotient of the domain and the kernel of the homomorphism is isomorphic to its image. This is illustrated in the isomorphism that Carla noticed between the quotient group {{1, 3}, {5, 7}} and the subgroup {0, 2} in Z 4 .</p><p>Building on the analysis above, it seems that for Carla, the entire center of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 25</ref>, from just below "Subgroup" to "Sets of Cosets," was essentially one concept: coset.</p><p>Although within that concept she could distinguish between left and right cosets, she did not distinguish vertically between the processes and objects. Regarding her use of the word normal, she correctly associated the word with the comparison of the cosets, but rather than reaching backward in the activity to attach the label to the subgroup, she reached forward and attached it to the quotient group. This labeling is not surprising when one realizes how distant the subgroup is when one is comparing the sets of right and left cosets. Furthermore, once the name normal was attached to the quotient group, it was very difficult for Carla to make any connection between it and the subgroup.</p><p>What is important in the diagram in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 25</ref> is not the names of the processes and objects but the structure-the relationships among the various components. Just as learning group theory requires abstracting from the particular names of the elements and the operations, thinking about the learning of group theory requires abstracting from particular names of the objects and processes. This conclusion alone is not very surprising, as it is obvious that different languages use different terms for concepts. The above analysis, however, suggests more. First, to learn group theory requires not only attaching names but also carving the activity into concepts. Second, making new distinctions and changing one's language both require accommodation in the sense of reorganizing one's conceptual structures. These ideas are elaborated in the next subsection.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>90</head><p>Lori: That's like Lagrange's theorem, wasn't it?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>92</head><p>Lori: I don't remember it, because I just learned it <ref type="bibr">[inaudible]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>93</head><p>Diane: Well, if this is a subgroup …</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>95</head><p>Diane: … then we know that it's a normal group of this and we got the subgroup of that.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>96</head><p>Lori: It's the order of the group divided by the subgroup. Like order G divided by H.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>97</head><p>Lori: Yeah, it was order G divided by H, but that was G mod …</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>98</head><p>Diane: Well, they're similar; they are the same definition G mod H. to describe a group of cosets, it seems unlikely that she was using the term as Carla had.</p><p>The phrase "order G divided by H" is ambiguous because of the lack of parentheses in everyday speech: Did Lori mean |G|/H or |G/H|? The former is mathematically problematic; the latter is standard notation only when the quotient group G/H is defined, which requires that the subgroup be normal. In that case, it is numerically though not logically correct as a way to count cosets because G/H and the set of cosets of H are identical as sets.</p><p>The issue of the meaning of G/H came up again later in the interview. Diane had again called upon the calculation 6 divided by 3 to justify that there would be 2 cosets.</p><p>Recalling that we had proved this result in class, I asked them what about the proof implied that 6 divided by 3 made sense?</p><p>291 Lori: That was the quotient group definition; Lagrange is a little different. Lagrange, like, stems from it. Is that correct? You actually had G divided by H under the whole quotient group definition. I remember that.</p><p>292 Brad: Right, but remember G is a group, and H is a group….</p><p>294 Brad: So a group divided by a group is a little different than a number divided by a number. I mean, you are doing 6 divided by 3.</p><p>295 Lori: Well, we are doing the order of G. Diane's phrase "divided by a group of 3 elements" suggests that her work with cosets and with Lagrange's theorem had become something like quotitive division: 6 elements ÷ 3 elements per group = 2 groups. This statement would be almost correct if she had used the term coset rather than group. But again she did not provide justification.</p><p>From what Lori wrote and said, it appears that she was considering only the orders of the groups in her division, so she did not see a problem of meaning in either "G divided by H" or "the order of G divided by H." As the interview continued, she seemed more concerned with what to write down than with its meaning: The way Diane interrupted me suggested that she too was thinking mostly about the orders of the groups.</p><p>I again distinguished between dividing groups and dividing their orders and stated that the quotient group was written as G/H, which Lori described as "no order" (line 332). Thus, for Diane and Lori, the concepts, processes, and notations for Lagrange's theorem and quotient groups were mixed together in a jumble of vague memories from class.</p><p>Moreover, the way that Lori moved flexibly from G/H to |G|/H to |G|/|H| suggests that the vertical bars did not carry much meaning for her and reinforces the point that the symbolizations were about the orders of the groups and not the groups themselves.</p><p>After we had determined that the subgroup was normal, we were ready to talk about quotient groups. I asked what could be done with normal subgroups.</p><p>368 Lori: Maybe figure out something with quotient groups?</p><p>373 Lori: So quotient group is just G divided by H.</p><p>374 Brad: Well that's the notation for it.</p><p>375 Lori: That's not the definition.</p><p>376 Diane: No.  Thus, for Lori and Diane, quotient group had little meaning beyond the symbolism G/H, further supporting the idea that they had been dividing not groups but orders of groups all along.</p><p>I asked several questions about what they typically might do with the set of cosets but did not get much of a response until I asked whether it would be possible to create a group.</p><p>Diane began making some calculations. Lori did not see what she was up to, so I asked Diane to explain. They completed their calculations and saw that it was a group with two elements that were sets, where one of the sets acted like the identity. I asked them what to call it. Diane's suggestion of "a group of cosets" was a good start, but she had a sense that she needed to provide a more precise description. Lori later likened it to a subgroup but saw that it was not a true subgroup, because "things are like sectioned off" (line 460).</p><p>They continued suggesting names: Again, they provided good suggestions, but they were not connecting with the language that had been introduced that day in class. I asked them what other words had been used in class and they suggested isomorphism and kernel. With that, they noticed that their group was isomorphic to the {e, a} group. I reminded them that the left and right cosets had been equal, and they pointed out that H was a normal subgroup. 531 Lori: … it didn't really, because if you just had it how would you come up with this set? So this is the normal subgroup, and this must be the quotient group, generated by that normal subgroup.</p><p>They both were uncomfortable about the idea of saying the normal subgroup "generated" the other cosets. Nonetheless, they eventually both pointed to the operation table they had created for the cosets and decided that it must be the quotient group. Lori, for example, said, "I'm thinking, by definition, this must be the quotient group" (line 540).</p><p>Thus, in the end, both Lori and Diane were able to compute and recognize a quotient group. They had no trouble making the calculations, once they got started, but they associated neither the process nor the result with the term quotient group. While trying to find a name for the group of cosets they had created, they had several good suggestions, including Carla's term normal group, but they decided to call the group a quotient group only after I brought up the term.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Students and Quotient Groups</head><p>An overriding theme in the analysis of the interviews above was the problem of attaching names and notations to processes and objects with which the students had developed some proficiency. In this section, I elaborate on this theme. The section opens by first returning to the previous discussion of the process/object distinction in the students'</p><p>understanding of cosets and then broadening the discussion to include the concept of quotient group. There was a strong sense in which the students understood cosets and quotient groups as both processes and objects, and yet there were ways in which their conceptions were incomplete, as evidenced by significant linguistic and notational difficulties.</p><p>The linguistic difficulties manifested themselves primarily in the strong connection between the concepts of normality and quotient group, because, after all, they both depend upon left and right cosets being the same. Thus, I next discuss the students'</p><p>understanding of the concept of normality followed by a presentation of the various ways that students tried to name the quotient group. The section closes by bringing together the issues of naming, notation, processes, and objects by considering the metaphor of gluing names to ideas.</p><p>Processes versus objects. Although a few of the key participants experienced initial difficulties computing cosets, they all were eventually able to manage the process, some of them with considerable proficiency. Thus, all the students developed process conceptions of cosets. After computing the cosets of a subgroup, all the students were willing to talk about cosets as being elements of a larger structure, a set of sets. They could compare left and right cosets and notice whether they were the same or different.</p><p>They could perform coset arithmetic, even in the case of D 3 , and could talk about whether a pair of cosets produced another coset. Thus, metaphorically, cosets were also objects.</p><p>Nonetheless, the students had difficulty using notation to support their thinking, and they sometimes used language ambiguously in ways that suggested that their thinking was immersed in the process of computing all of the cosets.</p><p>To begin their computations of quotient groups, the students often needed a direct question such as, "Can we make a group out of these cosets?" With that question, the process for creating such a group seemed obvious and natural to everyone except Lori, although she was quick to latch on to what Diane suggested. Operation tables served both to organize the students' calculations and to help them see that the result was or was not a group. Operation tables helped them think of cosets as objects that can have inverses or that can function as the identity. With the operation table they saw isomorphisms between the quotient group and other familiar groups. Thus, metaphorically, quotient groups were objects as well. Nonetheless, the students had trouble with the term quotient group and with the notation G/H.</p><p>A brief characterization of the students' concept images is roughly as follows: Cosets were objects, but aH was a process. The term coset applied both to an individual coset and to the set of all of them. When the left and right cosets were the same, the "left coset" could form a group, which was called "the normal group." Both of these were objects. Coset arithmetic was a process, and the resulting operation table was an object, yet the terms quotient group and the notation G/H referred to neither of these.</p><p>Clearly the hierarchical process/object distinction is insufficient to explain these results.</p><p>What does it mean to say that a student thinks of quotient groups as objects when the student does not call those objects quotient groups? What does it mean to say that a student thinks of cosets as object when the notation aH is not part of that understanding?</p><p>I reconsider the process/object distinction in chapter 8.</p><p>Normality. The students' concept images of quotient group were very closely tied to their concepts of normality. The common thread among the students' uses of the word normal is captured by Carla's statement, "You had left and right cosets that were equal to each other" (Interview 3, line 109). This characterization applies both to standard and nonstandard uses, including Carla's "normal group." All of the students gave such a characterization of the word normal at some point during their interviews.</p><p>What was different among the students' conceptions was the object to which the word normal applied: to the group of cosets or to the subgroup. When one determines that the left and right cosets are the same, the standard language points both back to the subgroup and forward to the group of cosets, attaching the names normal subgroup and quotient group, respectively. All of the key participants except Carla were able to point back to the subgroup to call it normal, although they demonstrated varying degrees of certainty.</p><p>Diane and Lori were willing to point forward while searching for a term to describe the group of cosets, suggesting terms such as normal group and normal coset group, thereby supporting the reasonableness of Carla's language. The terms quotient group and normal and the ideas they represent are so strongly connected perhaps it should not be surprising that the terms are sometimes confounded.</p><p>The students also demonstrated strong connections between normality and commutativity, often concluding correctly that the left and right cosets were the same when the group was commutative. Robert's concept image of normality was strongly connected to the word Abelian, a label applied to groups in which the operation is commutative. In his fourth interview, for example, when comparing left and right cosets of a subgroup, he said, "It does not look like this thing is Abelian as I predicted" (line 148). In his explanation, he focused on whether the elements themselves commuted with each other and then whether the left and right cosets were the same. Later, he seemed to be thinking that when the left and right cosets were the same, the resulting quotient group should also be Abelian, a prediction that is true for all of the groups the class investigated in detail but false in general.</p><p>Naming the quotient group. All of the key participants demonstrated some difficulty attaching the standard name quotient group to the group that they created from cosets. Thus, all the students came up with names for quotient group that indicated reasonable conceptual connections and that demonstrated a good informal sense of the concept. The connections to words normal and coset were particularly strong. Wendy was the only key participant who was able to give a characterization of the term quotient group without my intervention. Wendy's fourth interview took place after the final exam, however, so I hesitate to draw conclusions from this comparison with the other students.</p><p>In any case, Carla's insistence on calling a quotient group a "normal group" is not really surprising.</p><p>Gluing. The diagram entitled "Quotient Group Activity" <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 25</ref>) does not paint a sufficiently detailed picture of the conceptual complexity of what there is to learn. If the figure were to be augmented to include various symbolizations and Lagrange's theorem, however, it would become unwieldy and defeat its purpose. Thus, rather than constructing another figure, I state more simply that the overriding issue regarding the concept of quotient group was the confusion among the following: o the subgroup that gave rise to the cosets Each of the above is a signifier of some aspect of the students' activity regarding the concept of quotient group. Some of them are standard signifiers; others were invented by the students. The list is not meant to be exhaustive but rather is intended to demonstrate the complexity of making the standard connections among the various signifiers. Clearly learning the concept of quotient group is more complicated that is suggested by the metaphor of gluing names to ideas (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Hewitt, 2001</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">• names o Lagrange's theorem o quotient group o normal [group or subgroup] o coset group • symbolizations o G/H o G mod H o order G divided by H o |G|/H o |G/</formula><p>Perhaps some of the confusion was caused by the fact that the standard names, notations, and processes were introduced at about the same time. This explanation is probably insufficient, however, for the notation G/H seems to be very easily interpreted as division of natural numbers, and that was not the only confusion. Because the students were able to carry out the processes adequately and appropriately and were able to talk about the results as objects, a more plausible explanation is that there is considerable cognitive work to be done in attaching the names and notations to the objects and processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>Once again, the overriding issue regarding the concept of quotient group was one of language and notation. The students were happy to consider the cosets as elements of a larger structure. They often knew that in order for the cosets to form a group, the left and right cosets needed to be the same. Despite the fact that many of them needed some prompting about coset arithmetic, they seemed to regard the procedure as reasonable and even natural. By organizing their calculations in an operation table, they were able to see whether the result was a group. Thus, the students conceived of cosets and quotient groups as both processes and objects. Attaching language and notation to these concepts and calculations was problematic, however, and the students were aware of these difficulties. Regarding the term quotient group, other terms such as coset group and normal group seem to be more natural. More generally, some of their difficulties seemed to arise out of the strong procedural, conceptual, notational, and experiential commonalities between the terms, making it difficult for the students to manage the connections among them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main Themes</head><p>Regarding the concepts of homomorphism, coset, and quotient group, the main themes developed at the end of chapter 5 also serve well for organizing the results of this chapter.</p><p>Once again the students' use of language and notation emerged as a central issue. Once again, the students used operation tables and other conceptual tools for managing their relationships with abstract ideas.</p><p>With each of the topics in this chapter, the students' language and notation was sometimes nonstandard and often imprecise. Furthermore, the students sometimes had trouble with the concepts and process because of confusions about the language and notation. And even when they seemed to understand the concepts, they sometimes had trouble using language and notation in standard ways to support their thinking. They often left off quantifiers in their definitions of homomorphisms and began reasoning symbolically without adequately specifying their symbols. Nonetheless, at other times, the students' language was nonstandard yet precise. Carla, for example, consistently called a quotient group "the normal group." Furthermore, the students' seemingly idiosyncratic language was often not idiosyncratic, as there were commonalities across students.</p><p>The students often did not distinguish adequately between a set and an element, particularly regarding notation but even regarding their use of the word coset. The notation aH was sometimes a particular coset, sometimes the set of all of them, but mostly a process for generating cosets, although the notation did not always support the students' understanding of the process. The data suggest the problem of distinguishing between a set and an element might be better described as a difficulty conceiving of a symbol as representing a generic yet particular object. For some students, symbols such as 4x represented neither a specific nor a particular multiple of 4 but rather any multiple of 4. And if it can represent any multiple of 4, it is a short cognitive leap to imagine that it represents all multiples of 4. This kind of reasoning was characterized as being immersed in the process of generating all such elements.</p><p>The metaphor of gluing is clearly unsatisfactory to describe the cognitive requirements of making connections among language, notation, processes, and objects. Instead, learning to make standard linguistic and notational distinctions seems to require first conceptual distinctions and then a dialectic that supports connections among them. Thus, both creating and changing a student's use of language and notation require building cognitive structures that support and fit the linguistic and notational distinctions.</p><p>To manage their relationships with abstract ideas, the students often used operation tables to support their reasoning. Operation tables served to organize the students' calculations for determining whether a function was a homomorphism. Organizing their coset calculations in an operation table seem to help them see whether a set of cosets formed a group and also helped them see the result as a group-an object-with elements that were sets.</p><p>With the concepts of coset and quotient group, the students also supported their thinking through proficiency with the concepts, examples, representations, and related facts. For example, when creating tables of quotient groups, they demonstrated considerable proficiency with abstract groups and their representations, using facts about the tables in order to support their calculations and catch errors.</p><p>The process/object distinction was helpful in characterizing the students' thinking but was insufficient for making developmental distinctions. The students could conceive of cosets as objects, yet the notation aH specified a process. They conceived of quotient groups as objects, but confused the notation G/H with Lagrange's theorem. The data suggest that two encapsulations might be required for cosets: one to see a specific coset (say in Z 12 or D 3 ) as an object and another to see aH as representing such an object, which harkens back to the problem of imagining generic particular objects. These issues and themes are further elaborated in chapter 8.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PRELIMINARY MATHEMATICS</head><p>This chapter includes discussion of the relationships between the concepts in group theory and preliminary mathematical ideas that became prominent in my analysis of student understanding. While success in abstract algebra clearly requires broad and strong background knowledge, it was not clear a priori what background concepts would be implicated. The two concepts for which there were sufficient data for an analysis are functions and modular arithmetic. Because neither of these topics was explicitly investigated in the interviews, it is not possible to provide a thorough analysis of the students' understandings of either of them. Instead, I provide an analysis of particularly salient episodes that raise some interesting issues and then discuss how those issues played out more broadly with the other students.</p><p>Before presenting my analysis of the students' understanding of functions and modular arithmetic, however, I make brief comments about two other concepts: exponents and zero. These preliminary mathematical ideas likely played a significant role in the students' thinking, but little detailed data was available. The topics deserve mention here because of their importance in both group theory and school mathematics and because of potential implications for an abstract algebra course that aims to provide opportunities for students to strengthen their understanding of these key ideas.</p><p>Issues related to exponents came up periodically when, in unfamiliar settings, students were unsure what g 0 might mean or whether should mean ( or ( . In abstract algebra, as in school mathematics, the rules for exponents are initially defined for exponents that are positive integers. Those rules are extended first to allow exponents that are zero and then exponents that are negative integers. The guiding principles behind the extensions are, first, that the rules that work in the original system should continue to work in the extended system and, second, that the original system should be isomorphic to a subset of the extended system. Only with these guiding principles can the conclusions be adequately supported that g</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">4 − g 4 1 ) − g 1 4 ) − g 4 − g 0</formula><p>should be the identity and that may be either or because they must all be equal. These extensions are identical to the extensions from the natural numbers to the whole numbers to the integers- extensions that prove to be important and difficult for primary school children <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Kilpatrick et al., 2001</ref>). Thus, it should not be surprising that extending the rules of exponents requires some mathematical and cognitive work.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">4 1 ) ( − g 1 4 ) ( − g</formula><p>A more surprising set of issues that came up from time to time, and likely had some influence on the students' difficulties with exponents, had to do with the ontological status and properties of zero. Some students were convinced, for example, that zero is neither even nor odd. Some were convinced that 0/0 = 0. Because the status of zero as a number presented considerable obstacles historically (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Kaplan, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b167">Seife, 2000)</ref>, perhaps it should not be surprising that zero continues to be a difficult concept for some advanced undergraduates. <ref type="bibr">(See Nardi, 2000</ref> for an extended discussion of the role of zero in advanced mathematics.)</p><p>The concepts of exponents and zero are important in both undergraduate and school mathematics. With the available data, however, I am able to say only that the concepts deserve more attention both in the teaching of undergraduate mathematics and in research about students' understanding of undergraduate and school mathematics. Regarding the concepts of functions and modular arithmetic, this study provides more evidence and insight.</p><p>As mentioned in chapter 6, Diane's concept of function became a significant obstacle in her understanding of homomorphisms. An analysis of her third interview revealed similarities with the thinking of students who were able to complete the interview tasks successfully. Regarding modular arithmetic, several students used the word mod with unusual syntax, but the analysis showed Carla's syntax to be consistent and mathematically insightful. Other students demonstrated conceptual difficulties that may be explained by distinct but related uses of the word mod in standard mathematical language.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Functions</head><p>The concept of function plays a role in the abstract algebra concepts of isomorphism, homomorphism, and binary operation, though it is easy for its role to remain implicit for the concept of binary operation and for informal versions of isomorphism. The concept of function figured prominently when the students were dealing with homomorphisms, as they tried to manage the relationship between the function provided as a potential homomorphism and the binary operations in the domain and codomain of the function.</p><p>Before discussing these relationships in the students' understanding, I provide a brief discussion of two observations that suggest that some of the difficulties identified in the literature on the learning of functions continue to be difficulties for mathematics majors in advanced courses.</p><p>Based on the literature on the learning of functions, it is not surprising that some of the students in this study wanted functions to be given by formulas (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">Vinner, 1992;</ref>. For example, when I gave the students a potential homomorphism by specifying the image of each element in the domain, both Diane and Robert wanted to know what the formula was, and Carla also strongly identified the function with its formula. They were willing to assume that there was a formula, however, and thus were able to continue with the interview and with the tasks I had proposed.</p><p>The students' concepts of function were also marked by confusion between closely related terms and ideas. Carla, for example, temporarily confused the roles of x and y regarding the real-valued function described by y = x 2 when she said that when x is 3 the y-value would be 3 (Interview 2, line 32). A number of students in the class interchanged the terms range and codomain, an issue I chose to explore with Carla in her second interview. In the interview, she displayed connections and understandings built up around the terms. For example, she talked about the idea of restricting the range of a function, analogous to the way the domain of a function is often restricted in mathematical discourse. Carla's "equal-handed treatment of x and y" <ref type="bibr">(Lauten, Graham, &amp; Ferrini-Mundy, 1994, p. 233)</ref> seemed to contribute to a robust yet problematic concept image. Thus, it seems unlikely that her confusion could have been fixed by merely telling her she had the terms reversed.</p><p>The remainder of the discussion on the concept of function is intended to illustrate some ways in which the students' understandings of functions mattered when they approached concepts in abstract algebra. I base this discussion on an episode in which Diane demonstrated particularly unusual understandings and then broaden that discussion to illustrate how similar phenomena arose with Lori and Carla.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diane, Functions, and Homomorphisms</head><p>Diane's third interview focused mostly on homomorphisms and functions, and we did not get to the tasks about cosets. The following episode illustrates three aspects of her understanding of functions, which together impeded her progress on the interview tasks and likely obstructed her understanding of the concept of homomorphism. First, Diane's concepts of function, homomorphism, and binary operation were connected and intertwined in unusual ways that led to implicit (i.e., unspecified) homomorphisms.</p><p>Second, she had trouble attaching the names of and her associations with the concepts one-to-one and onto to the objects and processes under consideration. Third, she had an unusual concept of function that was connected to and supported by the notation. These issues were revealed slowly over the course of the interview.</p><p>When Diane provided her definition of homomorphism, she did not mention the word group, which perhaps is not surprising, since students in the course almost always were dealing with some group or other. I asked her how groups were involved: This appears to be merely unusual syntax, but, as will become clear below, for Diane a group could be a homomorphism and the group operation supplied the function.</p><p>I asked her to come up with an example and to show that it was a homomorphism. Diane began verifying the function was a homomorphism before she had specified what the function was. From her calculations (lines 21 and following), however, it is clear that the function she had in mind was equivalent to the identity function on U 8 , which, as an isomorphism, is necessarily a homomorphism. It seems unlikely that she would have described her thinking this way.</p><p>I asked Diane how she had decided that f(5) was 5 and f(7) was 7:   , and g, which were mod 8, mod 4, and the function that was used to "send elements over."</p><p>As Diane considered the function I had defined as g, she said did not know "what the function would be" (line 43), suggesting she wanted it to be given by a formula. She began using the concepts one-to-one and onto to support her reasoning, but she knew she was "fuzzy a little bit on the one-to-one and onto definitions" (line 114).</p><p>116 Diane: Well, I am remembering that one-to-one means that each element from G has at most 1 element in G′ that it's being mapped to. And then onto means that each element G has at least one element…. No, that's not right; it's the other way around. One-to-one means that G′ has at most one element being mapped to it, and onto means at least one being mapped to it. Is that right? Now I am not even sure what the definitions mean. I know one-to-one is at most 1 and onto is at least 1. I am not sure where it starts.</p><p>Thus, her concepts of one-to-one and onto were guided by associations with "at most one" and "at least one," respectively, but these associations were not enough to help her determine whether to focus on the domain or the codomain.</p><p>When the interview returned to determining whether g was a homomorphism, Diane described how she was thinking about the verification process:</p><p>In this episode, Diane's peculiar take on functions and homomorphisms was supported, in part, by the ease with which an element from U 8 could be transformed into an element of Z 4 . I then constructed a function h from D 4 to U 8 for which this would be impossible. In response, Diane used my specification without hesitation, saying, for example, "h(R 0 ), that sends R 0 to 1" (line 209) and later "R 0 is 1" (line 213), suggesting that she had made an identification of elements between the two groups in such a way that h was still doing the sending. When I asked her why she knew that h mapped R 90 to 3, she responded, "Because you said so" (line 233), implying that she was aware of my role in the specification of h.</p><p>I then asked her to think about g <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> from the previous example, and she responded that "g maps 3 to 0" (line 235). I ask her whether that was what she had said before:</p><p>239 Diane: Nope. I don't know why this would make more sense. I guess it's because we just did it in class or something. Of course, it shouldn't have made a difference.</p><p>246 Diane: That g was just…. I didn't think that g itself was doing anything really. So I thought that if I did this first, that g is actually U 8 .</p><p>247 Brad: That g is actually U 8 ? What do you mean by that?</p><p>248 Diane: Well, when I said "g(3) is 3."… In U 8 , g <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> is 3. So I think maybe that's what I was doing.</p><p>Thus, at this point in the interview, her thinking had changed, but I still had not reached much clarity on how she was thinking about the function g. I asked her to clarify:  <ref type="formula">(3)</ref>, where is that thing?</p><p>258 Diane: Right here in the middle.</p><p>259 Brad: What do you mean by that?</p><p>260 Diane: I haven't actually…. This by itself, g <ref type="formula">(3)</ref>, I haven't exactly done anything to it yet.</p><p>Diane imagined three different places where a value might exist: the domain, the codomain, and in the middle. This interpretation becomes clearer in the following explanation:</p><p>264 Diane: You take an element in U 8 , apply the function g to it, so now you have the function g of something in U 8 . So now it's no longer in U 8 , because you are applying g to it.</p><p>[Okay.] Okay? Now as you bring it over, g is not doing anything but mapping it over, just carrying it over. So, if you are stuck-well, you're not going to be stuck-but if you happen to be in the middle, you are not actually doing anything to the element. So it's still going to be g of an element in U 8 . And when you bring it all of the way over to Z 4 , then you are actually doing something. So g <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> is now 0 because you are actually over in Z 4 .</p><p>Thus, 3 begins in U 8 ; g <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> is the process of carrying the 3 over to Z 4 , which exists between U 8 and Z 4 but which does not actually do anything until the 3 is brought all of the way over, at which point g(3) becomes 0.</p><p>The above episode illustrates three issues, which are treated in different ways in the discussion that follows. Diane's implicit specification of the homomorphism from U 8 to U 8 is discussed below with reference to a similar episode with Carla. Diane's difficulty attaching the terms one-to-one and onto to aspects of the given functions can be seen as another instance of the issue of naming, which is treated in detail in chapters 5 and 6 regarding other concepts. Her nonstandard interpretation of function notation is discussed next with reference to Lori's understandings and interpretations of functions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Function Notation</head><p>The idea that g(3) denotes a value between the domain and the codomain is a nonstandard interpretation of function notation. Lori demonstrated similar nonstandard interpretations during her third interview, which took place separately from Diane's. She was working with the function f from U 8 to Z 4 , given by f(1) = 0, f(3) = 0, f(5) = 2, and f(7) = 2.</p><p>Regarding the notation f(1), she knew that 1 was in U 8 . She first claimed that f(1) was in the codomain because it was 0. Then she changed her mind: "I'm sorry, f(1), and that's in the domain, … but then when I take their functional values, f(1) is 0" (line 79).</p><p>I asked her again where f(1) was.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>83</head><p>Lori: f(1). Do you mean f(1) before it's evaluated? Or f(1) after it's evaluated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>84</head><p>Brad: Well, explain both.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>85</head><p>Lori: f <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(1)</ref> is actually in the domain. But then the functional value of f <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(1)</ref> is 0, and that's in the codomain.</p><p>Thus, Lori first imagined two senses of f <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(1)</ref>: before and after it is evaluated. But then she made a distinction between f(1), which is in the domain, and its value 0, which is in the codomain. So at first, the notation was ambiguous, but then she resolved the ambiguity by making an incorrect notational distinction.</p><p>As the interview continued, she decided that "f(1) is like 1" (line 91), which perhaps prepared her for a different notational distinction. I then asked her to consider another function g, which I did not specify, and asked her where g <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> would be. She decided correctly that 3 was in the domain and g(3) was in the codomain and made similar conclusions about f(1).</p><p>I asked her to explain how she had been thinking of it earlier.</p><p>Lori's focus on "before and after" suggests that she, too, focused on a process that occurred between the domain and the codomain. For Diane, f(1) was in the middle, whereas for Lori, f(1) was in either the domain or the codomain depending upon whether it was before or after evaluation.</p><p>It appears that there is something salient about the process of evaluating a function- something that led Lori to conclude, if only momentarily, that f(1) represented both the before and after of this process. Lori resolved this ambiguity first by placing f(1) in the domain. Diane, in contrast, resolved the ambiguity by creating a new abstract entity that existed "in the middle" between the domain and the codomain.</p><p>The idea that g <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> is a value in the middle between the domain and codomain is a reasonable, although incorrect, conclusion to draw from the notation and the metaphors.</p><p>In standard mathematical usage, when g(3) = 0, the 3 is in the domain, and both g(3) and 0 are in the codomain. But by imagining a function as a process, as a machine, or as something that "sends elements over," the process or the traveling will take time, creating a metaphorical need to notate a value in process or in transit. The notation g <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> is an obvious choice because the way it is written seems to suggest that the 3 is still inside the function and has not yet emerged as 0. For Diane, g(3) denoted this value in the middle.</p><p>This interpretation of the notation and the metaphors seems so obvious and natural that it seems likely that other students have come to similar conclusions, but the phenomenon has apparently not been recognized in the literature on the concept of function. Yet, the fact that I was able to observe this unusual conception depended, perhaps heavily, on the particular line of questions I asked. Without the particular question in line 257, Diane's unusual thinking would likely have remained hidden.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implicit Homomorphisms</head><p>Just as Diane's unusual interpretation of function notation was found to have similarities in the thinking of other students, her implicit specification of a homomorphism was an issue that arose in Carla's interview as well, as mentioned above. Both Carla and Diane began verifying that a function was a homomorphism before they had specified what the function was. In other words, they were working with functions defined implicitly and did not see a need to be explicit. On the one hand, for Carla, the function was inherent in the construction of Z 4 and was based on her conception of modular arithmetic, as is explored in more detail below. For Diane, on the other hand, the function was tied to mod 4, which she saw as the group operation. In both cases, the result was that their understandings of functions and modular arithmetic led to unexpected outcomes.</p><p>Diane's and Carla's conceptions raise serious questions about the prominence given to the canonical homomorphism f:Z → Z n given by f(x) = x mod n. On Problem 3 on the second take-home exam (Appendix B), the students were asked to show that this function is indeed a homomorphism, and the example was also discussed in class. These events occurred shortly before third interviews, which may explain why the function was prominent in Carla's mind. The issue is that the function does not seem to do very much,</p><p>giving the impression that the function is already part of the codomain and has little to do with a mapping between two groups. A similar statement can be made about the canonical homomorphism f:Z → nZ defined by f(x) = nx.</p><p>Another way to look at these episodes is to observe that Carla and Diane were not able to distinguish between a function between groups, the group operation, and the construction of the group. Thus, this is yet another example of a need to encourage students to distinguish among ideas that are closely related.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>Regarding the students' concept images of functions, I have presented a few issues that became prominent in the analysis and that had particular relevance for their understanding of elementary group theory. The issues seemed peculiar to Diane at first, but similarities with other students emerged during the analysis.</p><p>Diane's idea that g <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> was in the middle between the domain and codomain was a natural, although incorrect, consequence of the notation and the metaphors. Lori similarly had trouble placing f(1), and although she did not suggest that it was between the domain and the codomain, her language suggests that the process of evaluating the function was psychologically salient. The dominance of the process in function evaluation has psychological similarities with the dominance of process conceptions in students' concept images of cosets.</p><p>Diane and Carla both specified functions implicitly when providing examples of homomorphisms. The analysis suggests that their concepts of function, homomorphism and binary operation were intertwined and that the binary operations in U 8 and Z 4 , or, more simply "mod 8" and "mod 4," provided the functions that they were thinking about.</p><p>Thus, it is plausible that some of their nonstandard conceptions were related to their understandings of modular arithmetic, which is the focus of the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modular Arithmetic</head><p>Many students used the word mod in unexpected ways in the interviews and in class, suggesting that their concepts might have differed from those in the mathematical community. Rather than a thorough analysis of students' understanding of modular arithmetic, I focus on two episodes that provide grounding for the results. The section begins with a semiotic analysis of Carla's use of the word mod during her first interview.</p><p>Then I present an episode that occurred during a class early in the course when many students were still making sense of modular arithmetic. The conceptual analysis is postponed until after the episodes and incorporated into the analysis in order to give more of a sense of the phenomena that the analysis is intended to describe.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Carla and mod</head><p>All statements in which Carla used the word mod were collected for analysis. Focusing, in particular, on statements in which her language use seemed unusual, I constructed an explanation that accounts for most of what she said. The series of statements below is intended to illustrate the evolution of this explanation. In these statements, the word mod is set in bold to draw attention to those phrases that were the subject of analysis. The series of statements is interrupted periodically with comments and working hypotheses to illustrate how the conclusion grew out of the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>12</head><p>Carla: Because the addition wasn't a group mod n. Something about mod n isn't a group with addition, because multiples of.… Something about multiples of n. Let's see, mod n with addition. All right. For an identity for mod n, that would be just zero with addition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>61</head><p>Carla: S is just mod n under addition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>79</head><p>Carla: So the next thing to check would be associativity. But mod n is a subset of Z because all of your elements in mod n are integers, and Z under addition is associative, so therefore mod n under addition is associative. So therefore mod n under addition is a group.</p><p>Hypothesis: For Carla, mod n was a set. In Carla's written work, S denoted a set and she identified that set with mod n (line 61). The notion that mod n is a set, which is clear in lines 61 and 79, also fits Carla's language in line 12.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>94</head><p>Carla: Mod 5 means that a = 5q + r. Mod 5 means that you have elements called a that satisfy the condition 5q + r. It is kind of a way to back up from the integer group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>96</head><p>Carla: Okay, because if you take an integer, you can ... To me it seems almost like it's simplifying because you are dealing with less elements. If you take an integer, say 18, you can write it in a mod, and you can express.… Say you were dealing with mod 9. 18 is 0 mod 9, but 36 is also 0 mod 9, so it gives you a way to kind of group and simplify.</p><p>Hypothesis: For Carla, mod n was also an operation. Her statement in line 94 also indicates a connection to the division algorithm, but it is not clear how that relates to her other conceptions.</p><p>118 Carla: For example, the integer-I mean the inverse of 2 mod 3 would be 1/2 mod 3, and 1/2 is not an integer, and it is not in mod 3, and the only elements of mod 3 are 0, 1, 2.</p><p>189 Carla: If you are dealing with Z 3 you are supposed to add them in mod 3. So what you are saying is that the operation is different because you are dealing with mod 3 or mod 6. Yeah, I think I remember something being mentioned about that in class.</p><p>Note: For Carla, Z 3 was not the same as mod 3.</p><p>196 Carla: If you are dealing with mod 3, 2, 3, 4 is the same thing as 2, 0, 1 in mod 3. So I don't know. I think that it could be a subset because …</p><p>198 Carla: Well, I mean.… Actually, we already know it is a subset, I think that the mod 3 and mod 6 wouldn't make a difference as far as being considered different operations because it looks, even though the numbers are different, in the portion of the Z 6 table they are equivalent to the Z 3 table if you are dealing with (mod 3). Even though I think that something was said in class about mod … 2 mods, different mods are different operations.</p><p>200 Carla: Initially they seem the like different operations, but.… Oh, well actually we weren't debating really whether Z 3 was a subset of Z 6 . We are talking about, are their operations different? I don't know if they are different. I'm not sure. I don't think they are because I remember something being said about that they're not. And I have nothing that would make me think that they are the same operation. Because you are doing nq + r, but with mod 3 you are doing 3q + r and in mod 6 you are doing 6q + r, and 3q + r is very different from 6q + r. So I think they are different.</p><p>Conclusion: For Carla, mod n was the set that you get from "doing nq + r." This explanation accommodates the set, operation, and process interpretations given above.</p><p>On the surface, it seems Carla had a rather odd and problematic concept, but on a deeper level, there were some profoundly mathematical aspects of her thinking. First, Carla was able to think about the concept mod n as being both an object (a set) and as a process (doing nq + r). Second, the set is a set of remainders, which results from a process that involves stepping back (backing up) from the integers, and organizing them into equivalence classes, which she elsewhere described metaphorically as packages (Interview 1, line 98). Thus, Carla's mod n describes precisely, without using the standard names, the idea, the process, and the object that are behind the symbol Z/3Z, which simultaneously denotes all three. The idea in the standard construction is using the subgroup 3Z to organize the integers into equivalence classes, the process is creating the cosets, and the object is the group consisting of the three cosets under the operation of coset arithmetic. In other words, if Carla had instead said "Z/3Z is the set you get from forming the quotient (or the group of the cosets) of 3Z in Z," we would have been quite impressed. Of course, this language was not available to her at this early point in the class.</p><p>I have emphasized that the students' conceptual grids may be different from the accepted one, thus giving rise to concepts that do not fit the accepted grid. But here we have a case where the portions of the grid fit quite well but it is very hard to see the fit through Carla's idiosyncratic language. Her unusual language, in this case, does not seem to indicate a problematic concept. On the other hand, she did seem to focus too much on the division in the process, making her thinking somewhat slow and laborious.</p><p>These excerpts also suggest that some learning had taken place. During the interview Carla came to a determination that, when "doing nq + r," the value of n is a distinguishing characteristic of the related group operation: A different value of n indicates a different operation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other students and mod</head><p>I attempted similar analysis for other students and was not able to come to clear conclusions. Nonetheless, an episode from class provides helpful ideas for the analysis.</p><p>During the second week of class, after the students had been working for a while on problems involving modular arithmetic, Dr. Benson asked all the collaborative groups to spend a few minutes writing down every fact they could think of that was related to a = b mod n. They had access to two definitions:</p><p>DEFINITION Modular Equations If a and b are integers and n is a positive integer, we write a = b mod n when n divides a -b. <ref type="bibr">(Gallian, 1994, p. 8)</ref> We say a ≡ b mod n if a and b have the same remainder when divided by n.</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">(Problem Sheet 1, Appendix C)</formula><p>The students used both equality and equivalence, with the corresponding symbols, to describe such relationships.</p><p>During the discussions in this particular class period, several issues arose. For example, the statement 15 = 7 mod 4 created disagreement in some groups of students. Some students thought the statement was wrong; others thought that it just had not been simplified all the way. Wendy pointed out, "The whole point is you're getting a remainder." Another student suggested that the idea was to "Take a big problem and make it smaller." More generally, students wondered whether the following statements were equivalent: a = b mod n and b = a mod n.</p><p>For some students, these were not equivalent because a = b mod n meant that a was supposed to be smaller than b and than n; others thought that b was supposed to be smaller than a and n.</p><p>These notational difficulties were accompanied by more general algebraic difficulties.</p><p>Some students, for example, were not sure whether they should write n divides (a -b) or n divides (b -a), not realizing that the statements were equivalent. In thinking about the common remainder interpretation, one group first wrote r q n a + = and r q n + = ' b where q and q′ were quotients and r was the remainder. After some discussion, they decided that the correct expression was n r q n a + = and n r q n + = '</p><p>. b</p><p>The groups of students spent some time considering yet not resolving, many of the issues raised by the class. Dr. Benson said, Some of you are likely thinking, "Why don't they just tell us?" Well-and I don't mean this in a sarcastic way at all-we did. The point I want to make is that we did tell you and still there were issues that need to be resolved. (Field notes, Jan. <ref type="bibr">24,</ref><ref type="bibr">1996)</ref> A student said, "Wait! Problem Sheet 1." Finally, the class summarized the results on the board: Third, although the nine characterizations are algebraically equivalent, they were not psychologically equivalent for these students. Significant thought was required for the students to decide that some of these were equivalent to a = b mod n. One might hope that the fact that Characterizations 3 and 4 are equivalent would be obvious from the fact that a -b = -(b -a). But for some of the students, this was far from obvious, perhaps indicating insufficient proficiency with high school algebra.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>Can all of the difficulties be attributed to reluctance to consult the definition and to insufficient proficiency with algebra? Prompted by these events, I conducted a conceptual analysis. What was most surprising in this episode was the students' disagreements over whether Characterizations 1 and 2 were equivalent. The very notion of an equivalence relation implies that it must be symmetric. Just as a = b implies b = a, so also a = b mod n implies b = a mod n. What could be the cause of difficulty with something that should be obvious?</p><p>I claim the difficulty is caused by ambiguity in the notation. Specifically, the problem is polysemy: related but distinct uses of the word mod. It is not often recognized that the symbol mod is both a type of equivalence relation and a binary operation. The equivalence relation interpretation is what Dr. Benson had in mind in the episode described above. In other contexts, particularly in computer programming languages, 15 mod is a binary operation: an instruction to divide and keep the remainder. In fact, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Gallian (1994)</ref> makes this explicit: DEFINITION a mod n Let n be a fixed positive integer. For any integer a, a mod n (sometimes read "a modulo n") is the remainder upon dividing a by n. (p. 7) This definition is followed by computational examples such as "8 mod 3 = 2."</p><p>These two interpretations of the symbol mod create ambiguity in the interpretation of the statement 15 = 7 mod 4. If mod qualifies an equivalence relation, the statement is true <ref type="bibr">15</ref> Both Pascal, BASIC and use mod as a binary operator. C and C++ use "%" as the symbol for modular arithmetic, so that "17 % 5" evaluates to 2, for example. The mathematical programming languages Maple and ISETL use mod as a binary operator. Mathematica and Mathcad, on the other hand, use function notation, so that Mod <ref type="bibr">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr">5]</ref> and mod <ref type="bibr">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr">5)</ref>, respectively, are the appropriate ways to calculate 17 mod 5. because 4 divides 15 -7. But if mod is a binary operation, then the right side of the equation evaluates to 3 (the remainder after dividing 7 by 4), and the statement is false because 15 ≠ 3.</p><p>At least some people in the mathematical community are aware of this ambiguity. The mathematical typesetting language TeX, for example, provides two different commands:</p><p>"\bmod is to be used when 'mod' is a binary operation, … and \pmod is to be used when 'mod' occurs parenthetically at the end of a formula" <ref type="bibr">(Knuth, 1984, p. 164)</ref>. Some texts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Fraleigh, 1989</ref>) distinguish between these two uses by adopting the convention that Knuth describes, but this convention is not universal (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Gallian, 1994)</ref>. Dr.</p><p>Benson and I did not use this notational convention consistently, but other results of this study suggest that, even if we had, the students would not have used the convention consistently, at least until they also had made the corresponding conceptual distinction.</p><p>The conclusion, then, is that both the notational and conceptual distinctions should be made explicit in instruction, perhaps even making connections between the two uses. For example, the statement a ≡ b (mod n) can be translated into a binary operation interpretation as follows: a mod n = b mod n (in the sense that they both operations give the same result) Then, with the help of these distinctions, the students might be more likely to see the equivalence of the various formulations of equivalence modulo n, such as: a = b (mod n) if and only if n divides a -b a = b (mod n) if and only if a and b have the same remainder when divided by n This way, the polysemy of the word mod might be used to support rather than impede the growth of conceptual understanding.</p><p>In summary, this analysis supports three points. First, the distinctions among the several uses of the word mod should be made explicit in instruction. Second, the various formulations provide different conceptual support and sources of meaning, and several should be available in instruction. Third, the connections among the various formulations are not obvious and each connection requires some learning. What is unclear is which definition should be introduced first.</p><p>In fact, there is a third use of the word mod, as in the expression a = b (modulo H), where H is a subgroup of a group. The relationship between equivalence modulo H and equivalence modulo n is accomplished via the following generalization of the standard definition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">a = b (mod n) if and only if n divides a -b a = b (modulo H) if and only if ab -1 ∈ H (or a -b ∈ H, if the group is additive)</formula><p>It is difficult to see the meaning behind these definitions. Thus, it is worth asking whether there is an alternative definition that would suggest more meaning and simultaneously make strong connections with equivalence modulo n. The conceptual root for equivalence modulo H is the idea of remainders, but remainders cannot be imposed directly on a group and a subgroup, where there may be no division algorithm.</p><p>An alternative definition may be found via equivalence classes, but because the binary operation carries no notion of equivalence classes, a better route is through the concept of coset. The results of this study suggest that the above definition should be available to students for the meaning and understanding it might provide. Furthermore, this definition could provide opportunities for students to deepen their understanding of modular arithmetic, cosets, and the connections between them. Again, however, it is not clear whether this definition should be introduced before or after the standard definition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>This section explains some nonstandard uses of the word mod that occurred during Carla's interview and during a class early in the course. For Carla, mod n was the set the you get from "doing nq + r." Conceptually, Carla's nonstandard usage seems to carry the same meaning as the more standard statement that Z n is the set you get from calculating the quotient group Z/nZ and choosing representative elements. The class had disagreements about the correctness of several formulations of a = b (mod n). Some of the difficulties that Carla and other students had with the term mod are explained by the fact that the word is used ambiguously, both as a binary operation and as a type of equivalence. It is suggested that the various uses of the word mod, the various formulations of equivalence modulo n and equivalence modulo H, and the connections among them should be explicit in instruction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This chapter set out to describe the students' understandings of preliminary mathematics as those understandings came into play in their learning of group theory. The students' understanding of preliminary mathematics was not a specific focus of any of the interviews. Nonetheless, there were episodes demonstrating that the concepts of function and modular arithmetic are crucial and that sometimes the students' nonstandard conceptions appeared to obstruct their progress on tasks and concepts in abstract algebra.</p><p>Regarding the key concepts of function and modular arithmetic, the analysis shows that, just as in the previous chapters, students' understandings are intimately tied to issues of language, notation, and metaphor. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that students' understandings may be strongly influenced by the particular examples and particular definitions chosen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CHAPTER VIII</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS</head><p>This exploratory study sought to describe students' understanding in abstract algebra in the context of an undergraduate course. Using <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Tall and Vinner's (1981)</ref> notion of a concept image, which is the entire cognitive structure associated with a concept, the study identified prominent characteristics and components of students' concept images for central concepts in group theory, up to and including the concept of quotient group.</p><p>The setting for the study was an abstract algebra class for mathematics majors, covering many of the standard topics from group theory but in which lectures were replaced by collaborative and individual work on problem sets designed to promote connections between students' prior and emerging understandings and the concepts of group theory.</p><p>The analysis and the ensuing results are based largely on interview data with five students from the class. Other data sources, such as field notes and students' written exams, provided corroborating and contrasting evidence.</p><p>The research questions were as follows:</p><p>• What are the prominent characteristics and components of students' concept images as they are learning the fundamental ideas of group, subgroup, and isomorphism?</p><p>• What are the prominent characteristics and components of students' concept images as they are learning the more advanced ideas of homomorphism, coset, and quotient group?</p><p>• How do students' understandings of prior mathematics come into play as they are learning elementary group theory?</p><p>Detailed results for each of these questions, organized according to mathematical concept, are found in chapters 5-7. This chapter presents a synthesis of the findings, along with conclusions and implications.</p><p>What was initially most salient in the data and the results was that the students used and interpreted language and representations in nonstandard and unexpected ways that were not readily explained by available theoretical and conceptual perspectives on advanced mathematical thinking. On the conviction that the students' understandings were reflected in their language and actions, I endeavored to describe and explain the meaning behind their utterances and their use of representations. Through these efforts, characterizing students' concept images became a process of theory generation.</p><p>Specifically, through an analysis of language, the goal was to understand students'</p><p>representations and to represent their understandings. In this sense, this study was about the interplay among mathematics, language, and representations.</p><p>The results of the study derive from three types of analysis: detailed analysis of the interview transcripts, global analysis of the students' use of words and notations, and my own conceptual analysis of the mathematical content. The methods of analysis emerged through the analysis itself, and the research questions evolved as part of the process. The detailed analyses generated preliminary hypotheses that were refined through continuing analysis and synthesis. The global analyses involved searching the data for words and notations to confirm and refute the emerging hypotheses. The conceptual analyses served to make explicit the ways in which the students' use of language was compared with standard usage in the mathematical community. These analyses were performed iteratively so that emerging results could continually inform other types of analysis. The analysis and synthesis produced two main findings.</p><p>The first finding concerns issues of language and notation; it is described below as making the vague more precise. In short, language use that at first had seemed idiosyncratic and ambiguous was found to have common threads across students. The students confused related words and had trouble attaching names to their experiences in standard ways. This finding supports the position that attaching names to experience is not simply a process of gluing labels to pre-existing, "self-identifying" concepts but first requires cutting up experience and organizing it into concepts. Students do not necessarily make the same distinctions as those made by mathematicians and mathematics educators, and thus they cut up experiences in different ways, both indicating and further establishing a collection of concepts that are substantially and structurally different from concepts that are used in the mathematical community.</p><p>The second finding has to do with issues of representation and abstraction; it is elaborated below as making the abstract more concrete. In order to gain access to abstract ideas, the students relied on representations, metaphors, and other conceptual supports in order to manage their relationships with unfamiliar abstractions. Representations both provided and obstructed the students' access to abstract mathematical ideas and thus both supported and constrained their understandings. The result is well illustrated by the phenomenon I call reasoning from the table, in which the group operation table serves metaphorically as the group, supporting students' thinking and reasoning. The operation table is a representation that mediates abstraction, giving students access to and ways to think about abstract ideas but sometimes also impeding their progress toward an abstract view.</p><p>The conclusions continue with the suggestion that the two findings are distinct and fundamental aspects of mathematical activity. Learning advanced mathematics is a matter of making distinctions and managing abstraction, and language and representations are the tools. Mathematics is a complex interplay between logic and intuition, between precision and initially vague abstractions.</p><p>Following the synthesis of the findings, the chapter discusses some general implications for mathematics teaching and teacher education. The central theme is the importance of encouraging students to make their thinking explicit as a way to build their understanding and also to identify the distinctions and abstractions they are and are not making. The chapter closes with a discussion of implications for theoretical and empirical work in mathematics education.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Making the Vague More Precise</head><p>Learning advanced mathematics involves learning concepts, processes, language, notation, and the relations among them. That learning can be uneven, and what is learned can be connected (and disconnected) in surprising ways. A main finding of the study was the seeming independence between the students' ideas and the language of abstract algebra. Sometimes the students' nonstandard language was close to standard usage, as when they interchanged two closely related terms: using range for codomain, associativity for commutativity, or identity for inverse. At other times the students used a term more broadly than was appropriate-"the left coset" for the set of cosets-thereby introducing apparent ambiguity into their language.</p><p>In some cases, such ambiguity may lie mostly in a superficial interpretation of the students' utterances, for they actually used their idiosyncratic language precisely and consistently, as when one student used the phrase normal group for the quotient group that may be constructed when a subgroup is normal. Some students resisted attempts to impose standard usage, particularly when it seemed to contradict their own usage. Other students, in contrast, seemed to be much less precise in their use of language and also less bothered by ambiguity.</p><p>Of course, the use of standard language is not necessarily an indication of understanding.</p><p>For example, although many of the students stated on the final exam that a subgroup is (or is not) normal because the left and right cosets are (or are not) the same, some of those same students did not compute the cosets correctly.</p><p>Mathematical discourse depends for its effectiveness on subtle distinctions in notation and syntax that are established by convention. These distinctions, however, are not necessarily apparent to students. Furthermore, mathematical discourse is not without its own ambiguity. The word mod, for example, is used both as a binary operator and as a modifier of an equivalence relation, thereby creating ambiguity in statements such as 15 = 7 mod 4.</p><p>One way in which teachers and researchers can deal with such problems of ambiguity may be to focus explicitly on linguistic, notational, and conceptual distinctions, probing beneath the surface whenever possible. This idea is elaborated below along with other implications. In this section, I elaborate the linguistic, notational, and conceptual issues that arose in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Naming Concepts</head><p>Although lacking the rigor and specificity of a true instructional method, the "discovery method" exists, in name at least, in the literature and in some mathematics classrooms (see, e.g., R. B. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Davis, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Dean, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Mahavier, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Morriss, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b186">Touval, 1997</ref>).</p><p>In fact, the instructor for the class that provided the setting for this study characterized the class this way <ref type="bibr">(Benson, in press)</ref>. A description of the discovery method would likely include the following features: Give the students a rich problem situation to explore.</p><p>They will discover patterns and relationships, develop ideas and concepts, and create objects and processes. Then simply give the students the commonly accepted terminology, and with some metaphorical glue <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Hewitt, 2001</ref>), they will attach standard names to established objects or properties unproblematically. <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Leron and Dubinsky (1995)</ref>, for example, suggest that "except for the new name, the students can really feel that the instructor merely summarizes what they have found in their investigations" (p.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>238).</head><p>This study showed that the final step of naming is not necessarily routine and unproblematic. Learning mathematical vocabulary and its appropriate syntax is sometimes a complicated process with much potential for a misstep. What might explain the difficulties students have with the seemingly trivial process of attaching a name to an idea? I identified three kinds of naming difficulties, each with its own explanation.</p><p>The first kind of naming difficulty is that two words are sometimes confused when they involve closely related ideas. A person says one thing but means another, as when the students in this study swapped identity for inverse, commutativity for associativity, multiplication for addition, and range for codomain. Sometimes such errors are mere slips of the tongue; at other times the ideas themselves have become somewhat muddled.</p><p>In either case, these results are consistent with the observation from linguistics and cognitive science that such whole-word substitutions occur when words are semantically related <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Hotopf, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Stillings et al., 1995)</ref>. Cognitive science provides an explanation that fits with its models of long-term memory: Metaphorically, closely related words are stored in close proximity and thus are sometimes confused and hard to keep apart <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">(Stillings et al., 1995)</ref>. This study demonstrates that even when the boundaries between related concepts are relatively easy to draw, such as between the identity and inverse properties, the distinction between the corresponding words is sometimes hard to manage. When the boundaries are harder to draw, the distinctions can become quite problematic.</p><p>The second kind of naming difficulty seems to be caused by the name itself. In such cases, learning the name requires building some cognitive structure around the name to support its meaning and use. Sometimes, as in the terms cycle and identity, the name carries an everyday meaning that is somewhat different from the mathematical meaning (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Lajoie &amp; Mura, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Pimm, 1987)</ref>. Other terms have multiple meanings within mathematical discourse <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">(Zazkis, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Durkin &amp; Shire, 1991)</ref>. In this study, such polysemy was noted for the words mod and congruent, but only the former seemed to cause difficulty. With still other terms, the name carries content that begs explanation.</p><p>One student experienced just such a difficulty with the term isomorphism when interviewed early in the course. Perhaps the students' difficulties with the term quotient group may be explained similarly.</p><p>The first two kinds of naming difficulty are not particularly novel; both appear in the literature. The third is rarely recognized, however, at least in the mathematics education literature. Furthermore, it is of a different character from the other two because it is more epistemological than cognitive. The difficulty is as follows: The linguistic, notational, and conceptual distinctions that students make are not necessarily the same as those made by mathematicians and mathematics teachers. Some of the distinctions that teachers make are neither apparent nor relevant to their students. And students make some distinctions that their teachers do not make. Making distinctions, delineating concepts, and assigning names are, as Foucault <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(1971)</ref> noted, a matter of imposing order on experience:</p><p>Order is, at one and the same time, that which is given in things as their inner law, the hidden network that determines the way they confront one another, and also that which has no existence except in the grid created by a glance, an examination, a language; and it is only in the blank spaces of this grid that order manifests itself in depth as though already there, waiting in silence for the moment of its expression. <ref type="bibr">(pp. xix-xx)</ref> Foucault came to this conclusion through an historical analysis of two great discontinuities in the nature of knowledge in the seventeenth and early nineteenth</p><p>centuries, yet this perspective seems particularly apt for describing many of the discrepancies observed in this study between students' language and what I take to be standard mathematical usage.</p><p>In this study, the students used grids that did not fit with standard mathematical discourse. Some students, for example, did not make clear linguistic distinctions between a particular coset and the set of all cosets. To her, these objects and the process that connected them were all part of a single concept. In contrast, another student, discussing the meaning of g(3) = 0, not only distinguished between the value 3 in the domain and the value 0 in the codomain but also saw g(3) as a value that was "in the middle." Thus, in situations where a mathematician might see two ideas, the first student saw one, and the second saw three.</p><p>A problem in naming that involved several related concepts occurred when one student expressed many of the key ideas about normality and quotient groups but had not yet attached the standard names to those ideas. When the left and right cosets were the same, all the students knew that the word normal applied in some way. But what was it that was normal? The resulting group, the subgroup, the generator of the subgroup, or the cosets? And from the symbolic equation aH = Ha, there was also a sense that the word Abelian should apply.</p><p>In developing language to describe a particular area of study, constructing definitions and meaning is a matter of carving the area into a collection of related concepts, which requires imposing a structure on the area of study and a grid on the various activities.</p><p>This imposition is, in principle, arbitrary, although it is guided by historical and cultural precedent and by Occam's razor, a principle that has its roots in Plato's suggestion that we carve the universe at its joints <ref type="bibr">(Plato, 1998, 265e)</ref> and that was eloquently interpreted by Einstein: "Make your theory as simple as possible, but no simpler." When students try to make sense of an activity and to construct meaning for the various words, they, too, impose a grid on the activity, but constructing the standard grid requires that they see the joints that are implicit in the standard distinctions, some of which are historical accidents.</p><p>The results of this study indicate that students do not necessarily see such joints and thus do not use the standard conceptual grid.</p><p>Returning to the issue that opened this section, the results of this study imply that the discovery method underestimates the cognitive complexity of naming and, more specifically, that the metaphor of gluing names to ideas is too simplistic. The gluing metaphor implies that the experience is cut up into concepts that are naturally and unproblematically identified and, thus, that naming is a matter of assimilating standard names into well-defined cognitive structures that have been created by the experience.</p><p>This study suggests, in contrast, that cognitive structures are still being created during the process of naming. I am claiming not that the process of naming always requires building new cognitive structures but rather that sometimes assimilation is insufficient to describe what is involved in learning to use the standard language. And in any case, the resulting concepts may not fit with those of a teacher or researcher, not to mention the possibility of problems of fit among teachers and researchers.</p><p>During several interviews, after I had developed a good sense of the student's nonstandard language, I intervened and tried to encourage the student to use standard linguistic conventions and distinctions. In general, these interventions were not successful until the student had made the corresponding conceptual distinctions and thus had developed a psychological a need for the standard linguistic or notational conventions. Even then, learning standard usage seemed to depend upon a dialectic between the conceptual and the linguistic distinctions. These results suggest that learning new language and particularly changing one's use of language may be better seen as accommodation rather than assimilation. Therefore, it is necessary, at the very least, to pay attention to the distinctions that students make and to make standard distinctions explicit in instruction. These ideas are explored further below. The world doesn't come to us already sliced up into objects and experiences; what counts as an object is already a function of our system of representation, and how we perceive the world in our experiences is influenced by that system of representation. The mistake is to suppose that the application of language to the world consists of attaching labels to objects that are, so to speak, self-identifying. On my view, the world divides the way we divide it, and our main way of dividing things up is in language. <ref type="bibr">(Searle, quoted in Magee, 1979, p. 184)</ref> Searle's point, along with the results of this study, put a subtle spin on linguistic determinism. Language is simultaneously a social and a personal construction. The language that an individual experiences both influences and constrains the reality that the individual creates. The language that an individual uses influences and constrains that reality more fundamentally. These two languages are unlikely to match and might not even fit, however, for the individual and the community do not necessarily divide things up in the same ways, and thus their meanings can be substantively different.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning Notation</head><p>As with names, students' use of notation does not necessarily incorporate the same distinctions as in standard mathematical discourse. Thus, much of the above discussion about names applies to students' notation as well. In particular, the students in this study did not always distinguish between sets and elements, between the two different notations for permutations, between distinct elements in the same set, and between variables and names of elements.</p><p>These issues are examined further below as part of the discussion of the ways that notation can help manage abstraction. Here I point out only that many mathematical distinctions are maintained by notational conventions. Sets, for example, are denoted by uppercase letters, elements by lowercase letters. Functions are f and g; variables are x and y. The identity element in a group is e. Experience suggests that these conventions support thinking in the sense that it takes some psychological adjustment to think about a function x(f) or, as demonstrated in this study, to recognize that a letter other than e might represent the identity. The psychological support provided by these conventions is not often discussed in the literature. Yet, students do not necessarily adopt these conventions, making it difficult sometimes to interpret their work. And even when they do adopt the conventions, one cannot necessarily conclude that they have made the corresponding conceptual distinctions and abstractions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Using Definitions</head><p>The students' definitions in this class were a blend of formality and informality.</p><p>Although the nature and role of mathematical definitions was not an explicit focus of the class, definitions were periodically introduced, and the instructor and I regularly worked with students, both individually and collectively, to help them get better at using definitions. Thus, I took a broad view of definitions in the analysis for this study, allowing both formal definitions that the students provided on exams as well as informal statements that they provided when asked what a word meant. This approach was intended to increase the possibility of insight into the meanings that the students imagined words to hold.</p><p>The students' formal definitions often lacked quantifiers and were otherwise imprecise.</p><p>Their informal definitions were of varying degrees of correctness and bore varying degrees of resemblance to the formal definitions.</p><p>Some of the students' definitions were informal and either vague or missing important features:</p><p>• Subgroup means a subset that's a group.</p><p>• Z 6 means mod 6</p><p>• Z 6 means {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}</p><p>• Isomorphism means congruent, same form (with renaming and reordering).</p><p>• Identity means the do-nothing element.</p><p>Some of their definitions were informal but largely correct and potentially supportive of a correct formal version:</p><p>• Group means it's associative, it has an identity, it has an inverse, and it is closed.</p><p>• Kernel means the elements that are mapped to the identity.</p><p>• Homomorphism means a function that preserves the operation.</p><p>• Coset means aK or aH.</p><p>• Normal means the left and right cosets are the same.</p><p>• Quotient group is the group of the cosets when the left and right cosets are the same.</p><p>Other definitions were similar to formal definitions but were missing quantifiers or specification of notations:</p><p>• Associative means (a*b)*c = a*(b*c).</p><p>• Homomorphism means f(a*b) = f(a)*′f(b).</p><p>• Closure means for all a and b in G, a*b is also in G.</p><p>The students had trouble stating some of the formal definitions, particularly regarding the use of quantifiers, but their informal definitions served them well in much of their work and reasoning.</p><p>Because informal definitions were often helpful in guiding the students' intuitions, it seems counterproductive to suggest that their informal characterizations should have been discarded in favor of more precise formal versions. Further, as I argue below, both precision and vague intuition are necessary in mathematical activity.</p><p>It is worth exploring whether potential confusion arising from the absence of quantifiers and other imprecision can be reduced through instruction that makes explicit connections between carefully chosen informal definitions and the associated symbolic expressions.</p><p>For example, some informal definitions have quantifiers built in:</p><p>• A function is a homomorphism if it preserves the group operation.</p><p>Many of the students not only could state this informal definition but also associated the word homomorphism with the formula f(a*b) = f(a)*′f(b). Articulating the formal definition, then, is a matter of connecting the informal idea with this formula in ways that make the quantifiers explicit. This seems a promising approach because it acknowledges the importance of intuition as well as the need for precision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Generalization Versus Distinction</head><p>This study has shown through many examples that students cut up experience in ways that do not necessarily fit with standard mathematical discourse, leading to surprisingly novel or confounded concepts and to unconventional use of language and notation. This phenomenon is fundamentally about making distinctions and generalizations, which involves paying attention to some differences and ignoring others. In this way, making distinctions is the opposite of generalization.</p><p>Sometimes the students were too general in their use of language and notation and were insufficiently precise, failing to make important distinctions. Some, for example, inappropriately generalized the notion that associativity is a "global" property-a</p><p>property that applies to any subset when it applies to a group as a whole-and concluded that addition in Z n is associative because Z n is a subgroup of Z. Preventing or overcoming this generalization requires making a distinction between addition in Z and addition in Z n .</p><p>Conversely, at other times, the students were not general enough, making unexpected restrictions or distinctions, such as in considering g <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> to be "in the middle" between the domain and the codomain.</p><p>It would be disingenuous and unproductive to suggest that students need to pay better attention to differences, because many differences in notation and language are not significant. Sometimes small differences in a signifier denote large differences in the signified, as in the common convention of denoting sets by uppercase letters and elements by lowercase letters. Conversely, large differences in the signifier sometimes denote small differences in the signified. This is, after all, the idea behind the concept of isomorphism: noticing that two seemingly different representations are essentially the same and thus may be considered to represent the same abstract object. The problem is knowing which differences merit attention.</p><p>Making such distinctions is a problem both for students trying to learn mathematics and for teachers and researchers trying to understand and analyze students' thinking. Only by paying careful attention to language was I able to learn that for at least one student g <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> was "in the middle" between the domain and the codomain. Similarly, only by paying attention to the subtle distinctions between the words coset and cosets was I able to conclude that some students' concepts of coset were categorically different from the standard concept, in the sense that they did not adequately distinguish between a particular coset and a set of cosets. Simultaneously, however, I had a sense that other students' concepts of coset were not general enough, because they insisted that the process of calculating cosets must begin with the kernel of a homomorphism.</p><p>Generalizing the coset idea to subgroups required letting go of something (the kernel) that seemed central to the process as it had been introduced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Making the Abstract More Concrete</head><p>The students in this study demonstrated at least three ways in which they managed abstraction: metaphor, reification, and increasing proficiency. The students gained access to groups via operation tables, using the operation tables metaphorically to support their thinking about the groups. They gained access to cosets, quotient groups, and properties of binary operations by focusing on the processes associated with these concepts.</p><p>Eventually, through increasing familiarity, some of these processes were reified as objects. Also through familiarity, abstract objects and properties became more concrete as the students developed proficiency with the concepts, procedures, and examples, and gained a better sense of what to expect. These strategies are discussed in turn in the sections that follow.</p><p>Philosophically, it is possible to create abstract objects, properties, or categories by using a definition, a description, a process, or a representation, or by noticing a pattern or common properties. Notationally, it is possible to discuss abstract categories by choosing a generic member of the category. Psychologically, however, it seems there is much more involved.</p><p>Many of the results in this study can be viewed as examples of ways student reduce the abstraction level <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Hazzan, 1999</ref>) of a concept. But what do strategies such as metaphor and reification imply about the psychological processes called abstraction? Frorer, <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Hazzan, and Manes (1997)</ref> assert that are three different kinds of abstraction. Sometimes abstraction is about ignoring the pesky details. At other times, it involves thinking in terms of properties. At still other times, it is about one's relationship to an idea (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">Wilensky, 1991)</ref>. This last kind of abstraction is most helpful in explaining the results of this study. The first two kinds seem to require enough familiarity to be able to imagine generic objects that have particular properties or whose details can be ignored. This problem of imagining generic objects is elaborated below in the section about managing abstraction and trying to be general.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Operation Table as Metaphor</head><p>Operation tables served to mediate abstraction for the students in this study in that they worked with a concrete representation to gain access to abstract objects and their view of abstractness as a measure of one's familiarity with a situation, the table serves to increase one's familiarity, thereby making the abstract more concrete.</p><p>Operation tables served a metaphorical role for many students in that the tables supported their reasoning and helped them think of groups as objects. For some of the students in the study, the table was the group rather than a representation-a metonymic substitution of the concrete for the abstract. Their reasoning seemed to be largely external, in the sense that it was based in the table and in procedures that required that the operation table be present rather than in reflection on the binary operation. The cancellation laws (e.g., ab = ac implies b = c), for example, became embodied in the requirement that each element appears exactly once in any row or column. One student went so far as to describe the geometry of the <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">table, suggesting that for him the table was a geometric</ref> object with geometric properties such as symmetry. The geometric object was a metaphor that supported the class's use of the word congruent in discussing group isomorphisms. In fact, a congruence between two geometric figures requires specifying a correspondence between parts, just as a group isomorphism requires specifying a correspondence between the elements of groups.</p><p>The table served also to heighten the students' sense of anticipation about the way the calculations should turn out, similar to Boero's (1993) observation about the role of anticipation in algebraic manipulation. One student, for example, expected {5, 7} to be its own inverse. Many students came to expect certain patterns in their operation tables and likened those patterns to cycles, which caused some potentially problematic connections with the cycle representations of permutations.</p><p>The students in the study could see isomorphisms by looking at operation tables. Some of them were especially drawn to the squares of elements in the group, as the squares appeared on the diagonal of the table. They were able to see important differences between groups on the basis of the number of elements appearing on the diagonal.</p><p>The table as metaphor is not without its limitations, however. First, it becomes cumbersome for large groups, and extending the metaphor to infinite groups requires some sophisticated patterning abilities since it is not possible to write out the whole group table. Second, the students expected subgroups to occupy a corner of the table, probably because of an overly literal Groups-Are-Containers metaphor. Third, writing down a group table requires one to choose an order for the elements, which sometimes made it difficult for the students to recognize isomorphisms and to think of the order as nonessential. Nonetheless, through experiences in renaming and reordering operation tables, the students began to separate from the table from the group-the signifier from the signified-and thus began to develop concepts of abstract groups.</p><p>The results of this study suggest that the operation table can play a useful metaphorical role in students' thinking about group theory because of the conceptual support that the metaphor can provide. Still, it is important to make the metaphors explicit and to be aware of their limitations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Processes and Objects</head><p>In the literature, the process/object distinction is usually portrayed as developmental and hierarchical, with an object conception being the more sophisticated (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Sfard &amp; Linchevski, 1994)</ref>. The present study suggests, however, that this portrayal may be too simple. There were three concepts for which the process/object distinction was particularly relevant: group, coset, and quotient group. This study demonstrated that in all three cases that the emergence of an object conception was not necessarily an indication of a well-developed process conception.</p><p>Regarding the concept of group, all the key participants in this study demonstrated a strong object conception, often based in the operation table. Not all of them, however, demonstrated a strong process conception. When the students focused on the operation table, they took it to be an object-a whole with pattern and symmetry. Furthermore, subgroups were imagined as portions of the table-as subobjects in a sense-although this view was sometimes constrained by the arrangement of the elements in the table.</p><p>When the students focused on the processes involved in carrying out the operation, they were able to see that addition mod 6 is different from addition mod 3, although this distinction was sometimes overwhelmed by the sense that "addition is addition." The data give the impression that the process conception was more powerful and more sophisticated. Was the developmental trajectory reversed in this case?</p><p>One possible explanation is that the tables were not objects but pseudo-objects for these students <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">(Sfard &amp; Linchevski, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b202">Zandieh, 2000</ref>). When they were focusing on the table, there was a noticeable "externality" in their relationship to the group and its operation in that they sometimes needed to see the whole table before they could reason clearly, as mentioned above. Finding the inverse of a in Z n , for example, requires looking for 0, the identity, in the a row of the table. This process is easier to carry out when the a row is complete. Those students whose reasoning was based on the operation, on the other hand, were able to find the inverse of an element without consulting the table, sometimes even coming to the general conclusion that the inverse of a would be n -a.</p><p>Regarding the concepts of coset and quotient group, the results of this study are consistent with the finding in the literature that in order to construct quotient groups, one must be able to conceive of a coset as an object . When the students were able to compute quotient groups, they seemed to consider cosets to be objects. Contrary to the literature, however, conceiving of cosets as objects was not very problematic for these students, even for the student who found the process of constructing cosets difficult to manage. The students were perfectly happy to talk about sets of cosets and about a binary operation on cosets, both of which might be taken as hallmarks of object conceptions. They found it relatively easy to compute quotient groups in both Abelian and non-Abelian cases and seemed to see the calculations as rather natural.</p><p>Furthermore, after completing such computations and organizing them in an operation table, they saw the quotient group, and hence the set of cosets, as being an object, probably because their object conception of groups was supported by the operation table.</p><p>Nonetheless, as discussed above, many students found it quite difficult to use standard language to describe what they were doing. Moreover, regarding the concept of coset, there was a sense in which some students were stuck in the process, failing to distinguish either notationally or linguistically between a particular coset and the set of all cosets.</p><p>For these students, the notation aH signified the process for calculating the cosets.</p><p>In short, the students in this study conceived of cosets as objects but did not necessarily think of aH as representing one such object; they saw the operation table for a quotient group as being an object, but they had trouble calling it a quotient group. This result adds a subtle distinction to the previous finding that students have trouble seeing cosets as objects ( . It is possible that this study yielded a different result partly because the analysis, with its particular attention to language and notation, was more sensitive to such a distinction. It is also plausible to conclude that the different result was caused partly by the introduction of "arithmetic of sets" early in the course.</p><p>By the time the students were asked to try to create groups out of sets of cosets, performing an operation on two cosets seemed completely natural and unproblematic for many of them. By actually computing products of cosets, the students were able to see that it was desirable that the product of cosets be another coset. They also saw cosets as elements of a new structure, although most of them did not call it a quotient group during their interviews. <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Leron and Dubinsky (1995)</ref> suggest that the computers can support students' calculations with cosets so that they may begin to see cosets as objects (p. 240).</p><p>I agree and would add that this study suggests that hand calculation is also beneficial.</p><p>Taken together these two approaches suggest that proficiency with procedures helps turn vague ideas into objects. That is, both approaches support reification.</p><p>The inclusion of set arithmetic in the course may be supported for mathematical reasons as well: Coset multiplication is a special case of set arithmetic that has applications throughout abstract algebra. Thus, it makes sense to use these ideas to support each other rather than to keep them separate. Furthermore, by spending some time computing coset products that are not again cosets, students gain some experience with the mess that is created when a subgroup is not normal. They have an opportunity to appreciate the usefulness of the concept of normality and to explore the concept of closure in an unfamiliar situation. At the same time, they may begin to look for the kinds of regularities that support normality and their relationship with the overall group structure.</p><p>In other words, set arithmetic in general and coset arithmetic in particular can provide an experiential base on which to build an understanding of the more formal aspects of abstract algebra.</p><p>What, then, do the results of this study say about the process/object distinction? Is the process/object distinction truly developmental? One might argue in support of the developmental process/object distinction by stipulating that a student's thinking should be classified not as an object conception but as a pseudo-object conception unless it is an encapsulation of a process, conceived with generality and fullness. This solution seems problematic, however, because it guarantees that the distinction is developmental, in the sense that "object conception" would really mean "object and process conception," which would provide no theoretical room for object conceptions that are weakly supported by the underlying processes.</p><p>Alternatively, one might acknowledge that the process/object distinction is too blunt an instrument. After all, even for a specific concept, not all encapsulated processes are the same. Instead, researchers could try to characterize various kinds of process conceptions and also various kinds of object conceptions. Given the results of this study, however, this approach seems the more promising one, although it implies that there is considerable theoretical work to be done.</p><p>I do not have a satisfactory solution for this dilemma. I do suggest, however, that researchers remain cautious about attributing object conceptions to students on the basis of object-like language and, more importantly, about making developmental claims on the basis of such language. Certainly an object and process conception is a desirable goal for many mathematical topics, independent of the developmental trajectories that might be followed along the way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concept Proficiency</head><p>Early in the course, the students were tied to particular representations, such as the operation table, and tied to the processes. As mentioned above, the students' concepts became more abstract and more flexible as they moved away from the operation tables and began to think of processes as objects. These changes demonstrate the usefulness of metaphor and reification in managing abstraction. These phenomena alone, however, do not account for another prominent method of managing abstraction, namely, through increased proficiency with a concept. Again, by proficiency, I mean not only fluency with the procedures but also the ability and disposition to use understanding to reason about and solve problems with the concepts (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Kilpatrick et al., 2001</ref>).</p><p>This characterization was particularly noticeable in the phenomenon I called operation confusion. In the early interviews, some students were unsure of the operations in Z 3 and Z 6 and spent much of their time determining the operation. In later interviews, they were still sometimes unsure of the operation, but, in contrast, they were able to determine the operation quickly by relying on the group axioms and familiarity with the elements in the group.</p><p>As the students became more familiar with concepts and associated representations, processes, and examples, their concept images became richer and more flexible and efficient. Their work was more often guided by correct expectations, and even when their expectations were incorrect, they were increasingly able to notice errors and resolve inconsistencies by relying on multiple ways of thinking about the concepts. If abstractness is regarded not as property of a concept but rather as one's relationship to the concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">(Wilensky, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Frorer et al., 1997)</ref>, then increasing proficiency is a way to reduce abstractness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Balancing Precision and Abstraction</head><p>Thus far, the results of this study have been discussed under two themes: issues of language and notation and issues of abstraction. Elaborating and synthesizing these themes has led to the theoretical proposition that the themes are not separate but are fundamentally intertwined in mathematical thinking and learning. On the one hand, precise definitions, notation, and language are necessary for the precise thinking that allows careful distinctions to be made among objects. On the other hand, there is a fundamental human cognitive need to reduce the operative models-to abstract and generalize so that many diverse phenomena can be particular instantiations of a single idea. The results of this study suggest that mathematical activity might be considered a carefully orchestrated balance between two opposing tendencies: making distinctions among things that seem the same and blurring the distinctions among things that seem different. In other words, mathematical insight occurs not only when we realize things we thought were different are the same, but also when we realize that things we thought were the same are different.</p><p>Advanced mathematical thinking includes not only precise definitions and logical deduction (Tall, 1992) but also significant abstraction and generalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Dreyfus, 1991)</ref>.</p><p>Although teachers expect students to reason with sufficient precision and with sufficient generality and abstraction, in fact these are opposing expectations. Being sufficiently precise requires using rigorous definitions and careful notation to maintain important distinctions. On the one hand, some of the students in this study did not make important distinctions between set and element and between addition in Z and addition in Z 6 . Being sufficiently general and abstract, on the other hand, requires blurring distinctions among things that were thought to be different. Building a deep understanding of the group Z 6 , for example, requires that -1 be considered the same as 5. The very concept of isomorphism is about blurring representational distinctions in order to gain access to abstract mathematical objects that "lie behind" all of them.</p><p>Mathematical learning involves building intuition, creating mathematical objects, and making distinctions among them. Each introduction of a name, symbol, or definition, raises the possibility of making unusual abstractions and nonstandard generalizations and distinctions, for the standard distinctions are not pre-existing in the world of mathematical objects (wherever that is). Clearly there are more and less effective ways of maintaining the balance between precision and abstraction, but the best solutions are rarely clear a priori. Thus, students should be expected to make unusual distinctions regularly as part of the learning process.</p><p>My argument about the balance between making and blurring distinctions echoes <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Poincaré's (1946)</ref> observation that logic and intuition play complementary roles in mathematics. Guided by intuition alone, one defines mathematical objects vaguely.</p><p>Intuition cannot bring certainty and can even deceive, so rigor is necessary. Rigor requires logic and begins with definitions, but logic can create nothing new. Thus, logic and intuition are each indispensable.</p><p>Building on Poincaré's argument, logic is about precision, making careful distinctions, and reasoning from rigorous definitions and axioms. But formal definitions alone are empty. Instead, there must be something to formalize, some intuition that is being made precise. Definitions themselves do not create mathematical meaning. Instead, they allow for distinctions among objects that have been or might be created by other processes.</p><p>These propositions imply not that intuition must precede definitions but rather that definitions must be populated with mathematical objects before there can be any meaning.</p><p>Intuition, on the other hand, is guided by abstractions and generalizations that are well supplied with examples. Yet, intuition alone is vague and ambiguous, and meaning remains confused until the intuitions have been carefully delimited and distinguished from related ideas. That, of course, requires logic and precise definitions.</p><p>Effective mathematical communication requires that both the speaker and the hearer (or the writer and the reader) have constructed abstractions and distinctions that are somewhat comparable, in the sense of fit. Effective mathematical learning involves building such abstractions and distinctions. When and how does this happen? It is a wonder that it happens at all, given that so much of it is implicit.</p><p>Poincaré's argument suggests that in the history of mathematics, precise definitions were the result of a slow evolutionary dialectic between logic and intuition. That suggests the hypothesis that one way of improving students' abstraction and distinctions, along with their intuition and use of definitions, is to make this dialectic explicit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managing Abstraction and Trying to be General</head><p>In elaborating and synthesizing the results of this study, I saw the students' use of notation at first as an issue that was mostly about imprecision and ambiguity. It now appears, however, that notation is simultaneously a tool for mediating abstraction. The claim that notation is used both to manage abstraction and to impose precision may be seen as a rephrasing of a guiding principle of semiotics: that a sign is not meaningful in itself but rather is meaningful within a system of signs. This point becomes particularly apparent when comparing the students' use of notation with standard usage.</p><p>In introducing and discussing the concept of binary operation, the instructor used a diamond or a star, intending to denote a generic operation, which might be any familiar or unfamiliar operation but which is imagined to be particular but unspecified. The generality is that in any problem (or proof) setting the diamond may denote any operation that satisfies the context, and thus any reasoning and results apply to all such operations.</p><p>This generality leads to an abstraction, which is the creation of a new concept-binary operation-that is the set of all possible binary operations, familiar and unfamiliar, known and unknown, specified and unspecified. In this study, the students sometimes saw neither the generality nor the abstraction, but instead saw the diamond as another specific operation, distinct from both addition and multiplication. Furthermore, some of the students decided that the diamond was to be used when the elements were a and b, which we "don't know how to add."</p><p>Similarly, the instructor provided the students access to the set of all finite cyclic groups through the notation Z n . The notation is general in the sense that it can stand for any such group, but it depends upon an abstraction: the set of all such groups. Once again, some of the students did not see the generality and abstraction, as evidenced by their statements that Z 3 and Z 6 were subgroups of Z n . Unfortunately, the data are not sufficient regarding this phenomenon to provide a clear picture of the object that they were calling Z n . The data do suggest, however, that these students saw Z n not as a particular but unspecified group but rather as another specific group, and, furthermore, that "any Z group" (except perhaps Z itself) might be considered a subgroup of Z n . I use the students' language "any Z group" here because the standard language and notation yields a sentence that is striking in its ambiguity: "For any n, [what is commonly called] Z n might be considered a subgroup of [what these students called] Z n ." Again, it is not clear what object the latter Z n denotes. Either the students were not aware of their ambiguous use of the symbol Z n , or they were not particularly concerned by it.</p><p>The students' ambiguous use of notation proved to be an indicator of issues with both abstraction and precision. In the case of diamond and Z n , the students were not making the intended abstractions, thereby introducing ambiguity into their use of the notations.</p><p>In other cases, students used notation ambiguously when they did not make important distinctions, such as with the notation aH, which for some students represented both a particular coset and all such cosets. Similarly, some students used a symbol such as 4x to denote both a particular multiple of 4 and all multiples of 4. One student also used 4x to denote two (possibly distinct) multiples of 4.</p><p>Actually, it should not be surprising that students use notation ambiguously, for standard mathematical discourse uses notation that might appear to students to be ambiguous.</p><p>Notational precision is not in the notation itself, but is implied by the surrounding text.</p><p>Compare the following typical phrases that might come from an abstract algebra class:</p><p>• Suppose G is a group and a, b ∈ G.</p><p>• An operation * is commutative on a set G if a*b = b*a for all a, b ∈ G.</p><p>• Suppose G is a group with 3 elements, e, a, and b, and suppose e is the identity.</p><p>This study suggests that some, perhaps many, students would call a and b variables in these statements, yet that label may obscure subtle but important distinctions revealed by the differences in syntax. In the first statement, a and b represent unspecified but particular elements of G. Unless stated otherwise, they cannot be assumed distinct.</p><p>Generality may come later, in that whatever is argued about a and b will hold for any pair a, b in G. In the second statement, a and b are pattern generalizers. We imagine that a and b vary through all possible pairs in G, and in any such pair a and b are not necessarily distinct. The generality is in the statement itself. In the third statement, a and b are specific elements of the group G. They are names of the elements of G, and they are necessarily distinct. The generality comes later, and only as part of another abstraction: that there is only one group of order 3.</p><p>So what does this discussion imply about the relationship between generalization and abstraction? Sometimes it is hard to separate them. General reasoning seems to require abstractions. Commutativity, for example, requires imagining all possible pairs of elements from a set. General reasoning about a binary operation requires ability to imagine a generic operation. Is it necessary to construct the abstraction that is the set of all binary operations? Is it possible to imagine to be an arbitrary function without imagining the set of all of such functions? I say yes, although one needs to be able to imagine a wide range of diverse possibilities. In other words, general reasoning about a concept requires a significant psychological step toward the mathematical abstraction that is the set of all instances of that concept. is taken to denote the entire function, despite the misleading metonymy-in this case, substituting a generic pair for the set of all such pairs. The literature on the learning of functions suggests, however, that students have difficulty making the transition from x being a particular value to being a variable that takes all values in the domain.</p><p>By treating aK both as a specific coset and as representing all of them, some of the students demonstrated that they had applied a similar metonymy in a context where it is not often done. This ambiguity and flexible use of notation is not surprising when one considers that there is no common notation for the set of all cosets of a subgroup when the subgroup is not normal. Of course, in some contexts it is easy to make notational distinctions between a generic value and the set of all such values, such as in 4x + 1 and 4Z + 1.</p><p>From a psychological point of view, it is easy to see why students have trouble making distinctions between a generic value and the set of all such values. If a symbol can represent any suitable value, it is a short conceptual leap to considering all of them. To better portray the relationship between the mathematical and psychological distinctions, the relevant distinctions are superimposed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 26</ref>. The important mathematical distinction is usually between the generic value and the set of all such values, and the distinction may be managed metaphorically by first imagining that a value is fixed and then imagining that it varies through all such values and the result is collected in a set. Mathematicians do not make an ontological distinction between a specific value, a generic value, and any such value, but the mathematical status of "all such values" is problematic unless those values are collected in a set. Thus, there are essentially two kinds of mathematical objects on this continuum, and mathematicians use notation and context as a way of managing the distinction between them.</p><p>The students in this study, in contrast, were often thinking simultaneously of any and all values, so that the important mathematical distinction was neither apparent nor relevant.</p><p>When they talked about all values, they sometimes did not bother to collect the values in a set, suggesting that this distinction was also irrelevant. A specific value was psychologically distinct from the idea of any value, but the idea of a generic particular value seemed to be unavailable to them.</p><p>Thus, there are important mathematical distinctions between a generic value and the set of all such values, and standard notation conventions provide inconsistent and sometimes ambiguous support. But when and how might students learn such conceptual and notational distinctions? Such distinctions seem to depend also on careful interpretation of the text that surrounds the introduction of the notation and on metaphors such as "imagine x is fixed." I suspect that many difficulties with quantification may be partially explained by this result.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p>The preceding sections have included many implications about the teaching and learning of abstract algebra in particular and mathematics more generally. In this section, I focus on what I see as this study's most important implications for teaching, teacher education, and research. Most of these implications grow out of the dialectic between making distinctions and managing abstraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Teaching</head><p>The results of this study make clear that students do not necessarily make standard conceptual, linguistic, and notational distinctions; in fact, the standard distinctions might not even be relevant or apparent to students. This finding has implications for teaching because of the potential for failure of communication when the teacher and the students are using conceptual grids that do not fit with one another. To overcome this obstacle, teachers must become aware of the distinctions that students are and are not making.</p><p>This awareness is possible only by encouraging students to make their thinking explicit.</p><p>Then, informed by knowledge of the students' thinking, teachers may help them make important conceptual distinctions and encourage them to make more of the standard distinctions in their language and notation.</p><p>The teaching of advanced mathematics must be sensitive to language, notation, and the important conceptual distinctions that the linguistic and notational distinctions are intended to convey. Consequently, language and notation should periodically be given explicit attention in instruction. This suggestion for teaching is consistent with and provides additional support for the communication and representation standards proposed by the NCTM <ref type="bibr">(1989,</ref><ref type="bibr">2000</ref>). Thus, one could suggest that mathematics teachers at all levels should ask open questions that allow students' linguistic, notational, and conceptual difficulties to become apparent. Students should be supported through instruction to translate early and often among the various signifiers of a mathematical object or property, including names, definitions, symbols, and other representations.</p><p>Furthermore, students should be encouraged to articulate their thinking, for it is only through such articulation that nonstandard conceptions might be noticed.</p><p>The interview data collected for this study are noteworthy for their richness and for the fact that the students were often able to talk for long stretches with little intervention from me. The design of the study did not permit any attribution of the cause of this richness, but a plausible contributing factor was that, in this course, the students were often expected to articulate their thinking not only in their collaborative groups but also during office hours and on their written work. This interpretation implies that cooperative work can support learning by encouraging students to make their thinking explicit, even if they are not equipped to notice unusual conceptions and are not yet fluent in the standard vocabulary and syntax. Such work can also provide instructors with a window into students' thinking.</p><p>Asking students to make their thinking explicit can serve to also inculcate habits of mind that may be important to mathematics learning, such as asking the questions, "What does it mean to say that … ?" or "What would we need to do to show that … ?" Furthermore, by articulating their thinking, students who are not yet strong conceptually or procedurally can demonstrate important mathematical habits of mind that deserve to be supported by instruction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparation of Teachers</head><p>Part of the rationale for conducting this study was that a course in abstract algebra is often required in the preparation of secondary school teachers. Thus, it makes sense to ask whether the study has implications for that preparation. A thorough investigation of the role and relevance of abstract algebra in the preparation of teachers would require a very different set of studies that would, of necessity, include significant work in secondary school mathematics classrooms to determine which ideas from abstract algebra are useful in teachers' instruction, planning, and reflection. Nonetheless, this study supports three observations. First, abstract algebra could be a setting in which preservice teachers develop a deep sense of the nature and role of definitions and proof in mathematics. If secondary teachers are to develop in their students a sense of mathematical reasoning and proof, as is currently recommended <ref type="bibr">(NCTM, 2000)</ref>, then the teachers must themselves understand how definitions and proof support mathematical reasoning. These were secondary goals of the class that provided the setting for this study, the primary goal being that the students develop an intuitive and experiential sense of the concepts. Thus, it is perhaps not surprising that the students' proofs and definitions were more uneven in quality than, say, their computations of cosets and quotient groups. It would be worth designing an abstract algebra course for preservice teachers in which intuition and rigor were twin goals and explicit foci of instruction.</p><p>Second, it is important that preservice teachers come to have a sufficiently abstract view of the concepts of inverse, identity, and binary operation, and to be able to see many examples as instantiations of the main ideas. Because the secondary mathematics curriculum includes the concept of inverse functions, for example, teachers need sufficient sense of the more abstract concept of inverse to be able to treat inverse functions in ways that are faithful to the abstract concept. Although cosets and quotient groups are certainly good candidate topics for teaching the roles of definitions and proof, this research has not convinced me that cosets and quotient groups are necessary background for high school mathematics teachers, because there are few obvious connections with high school mathematics. For preservice teachers who are to learn about quotient groups, the results of this study suggest paying particular attention to the structural relationships between Z and Z n , for that is where the teachers can gain a firm and subtle sense of the relationships between addition of integers and addition modulo n.</p><p>Third, the results of this study suggest that sensitivity to conceptual, linguistic, and notational distinctions should be an explicit focus of the pedagogical preparation of teachers. As mentioned above, there is good reason to believe that secondary mathematics learning will be enhanced if students are often encouraged to make their thinking explicit. For that to happen in secondary school mathematics classrooms, preservice teachers should be encouraged not only to reflect on their own language and notation and to make their thinking explicit but also to reflect on such experiences as a way to help them see the pedagogical benefits of mathematical communication and the importance of making careful distinctions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empirical and Theoretical Research</head><p>Many of the conclusions and implications in this chapter carry messages for research. In particular, the themes of making distinctions and managing abstraction can be seen as the beginning of a theoretical construct that takes seriously both logic and intuition. In this section, I make additional comments about some of the other theoretical constructs that informed this research and make suggestions for additional research.</p><p>First, the results of this study suggest that concept image may be a problematic construct if it is take to suggest a prescribed way of cutting up experience into concepts. The data and analysis demonstrate that students do not necessarily make standard conceptual, linguistic, and notational distinctions. To accommodate this emergent result, the analysis for this study depended upon a flexible notion of a concept image that allowed conceptual boundaries to migrate in order to explain the data. That flexibility was accomplished via a semiotic conceptual framework, which allowed consideration of the standard concept, the extent to which a student had mastered the concepts and processes, and the meanings that the student associated with the names and notations. In particular, by paying careful attention to the students' use of language and notation by separating names, symbols, and definitions in the analysis, I was able to characterize their concept images in ways that explained their nonstandard use of language and notation. Any viable notion of concept image must maintain similar flexibility that does not require that the name of the concept be the organizing determinant.</p><p>Second, as discussed in detail above, the results of this study suggest that the process/object distinction is more subtle and nuanced than is commonly portrayed in the literature. In particular, it appears that sometimes the developmental hierarchy can be circumvented when a representation supports an object conception without requiring a robust process conception. Many questions remain, however. For example, when is it advantageous to inject into instruction representations that support object conceptions before students have developed a robust process conception?</p><p>It might be profitable to acknowledge that not all process conceptions and not all object conceptions are the same. Even without comparing two different individual learners, it is clear that constructing an object conception is not the completion of a learning process but rather the beginning of a new phase of learning about the concept. In other words, an object conception creates new possibilities. Some of this might be captured by acknowledging the gradual development of conceptual proficiency, which might be described as increasing richness in one's process conception, increasing applicability of one's object conception, and increasing ability to move between the two.</p><p>This study suggests that much is to be gained by paying attention to the ways that students manage abstraction, particularly their use of metaphors and representations.</p><p>Although it is clear that the students in this study did not necessarily make the standard distinctions between any object of a kind and all such objects, it appears that the idea of a particular unspecified object was not available to some of the students. I hypothesized above that metaphors such as "imagine it is fixed" may help, but many questions remain about the psychological requirements for imagining a generic object. Furthermore, there may be many more as-yet-unidentified metaphors that both support and constrain thinking in abstract algebra in particular and advanced mathematics more generally.</p><p>If we take Poincaré's dialectic seriously, it is fair to say that this study focused on intuition at the expense of logic. I studied mostly students' informal definitions, and proof was not an explicit area of investigation. This decision made sense given the context, the available literature, and my particular interests. My intent was to study the meanings that students construct for the various concepts in group theory and to characterize those understandings. It is now quite clear, however, that the logical side needs equal attention, for that is the way that students begin to make more careful distinctions that are necessary for clear thinking and for effective participation in mathematical discourse. The semiotic perspective makes clear, after all, that signs have meaning not in themselves, but within a system of signs. Thus, many questions remain about how students learn to use definitions, notation, and language precisely, and to use such rigor in the service of reasoning, proof, and communication and to support further development of intuition.</p><p>For the continued investigation of learning in abstract algebra in particular and advanced mathematical thinking more generally, the conceptual and analytic framework developed here can offer a good starting point. The framework was developed in order to characterize students' understandings, focusing on meaning and intuition. Because it supports identification of distinctions that students do and do not make, the framework seems equally applicable to investigating not only the logical side of mathematical thinking but also the relationship between logic and intuition.</p><p>Perhaps future research in advanced mathematical thinking could take advantage of the dialectic between intuition and logic. Beginning with logic, one might ask, What does it take to build stronger connections between symbolic proofs and the examples to which the proofs are intended to apply and the intuitions the proofs are intended to formalize?</p><p>Beginning with intuition, one might ask, What does it takes to encourage students to make distinctions that are not apparent to them? An extended research program could ask, What does it take for students to come to sophisticated understandings of the nature and role of definitions and proof in mathematics?</p><p>Research in advanced mathematical thinking is still a young field with many open questions, many challenges, and many opportunities. This study has explored linguistic, notational, and conceptual issues for undergraduate students in a particular abstract algebra class and has provided detailed results about the students' learning of particular concepts. Some of the conceptual issues and theoretical explanations are of sufficient generality to suspect that they may be useful in describing advanced mathematical thinking more generally. Thus, the study has also provided insights about some of the theoretical constructs commonly used in research on advanced mathematical thinking. In addition, the study has put forward and elaborated the theoretical proposition that mathematical thinking and learning may be viewed as a balance between precision and abstraction and has suggested that balance is needed in both the research on advanced mathematical concepts and the practice of teaching advanced mathematics. I hope the empirical and theoretical results presented here will influence the research agenda and ultimately will serve to improve the learning of mathematical concepts that historically have been among the most challenging in the undergraduate curriculum. This course will most likely be very different from your previous mathematics classes, both in content and in instructional style. However, the choices we'll be making are based on a significant amount of research on teaching and learning, as well as on our own experience as students and teachers of mathematics (specifically abstract algebra). It might be a little hard to get used to, at first, but I really believe that this is the best way to get us to our goal, developing an understanding of, and facility with, abstract algebra concepts and their applications. We will be taking a discovery approach in this class, which means that, during class time, you will be doing mathematics, rather than watching me do mathematics. Of course, there may very well be occasions, during class discussions for instance, that I might clarify some points or explain some details or define some terminology. As part of the discovery approach, we will often be working in KN M327 (the computer lab in Kingsbury) or the Morse Hall computer lab (a.k.a. Spicerack) using a variety of software packages designed for abstract algebra This software will be useful both for learning and for applying the concepts we'll be learning. Although we won't be following the book in "lock-step" fashion, we will be using it as a supplement to what we do in class. I find Gallian's book to be very readable with lots of nice examples, problems, and references.</p></div>

Most of this work will be collected, some of it will be graded, but all collected work will be looked at and commented on (a preposition is a terrible thing to end a sentence with).</p><p>Homework is self-explanatory, I suppose. Like classwork, most, if not all, of it will be looked at and some will be assigned a grade. Sometimes, the grade will depend only on whether you made a reasonable attempt to solve the problem, while other times the homework will be graded in a more "traditional" way. In addition to regular homework, there will be occasional "projects" which will be designed to pull together some of the key concepts we've dealt with in class. These projects might involve both group and individual work, depending on the particular project, and you'll typically be given several days to complete them. Since you have a little extra time, it will also be important for you to be sure that you write up your work carefully and completely. Being able to solve a mathematical problem is just part of the mathematical process. It's also important that you be able to explain your work and its justifications to others. Of course, you should also write up your homework carefully, but I realize you won't have as much time to work on it! There will be two midterm exams during the semester (times to be announced during the first two weeks of class). There will be both in-class and take- home components to these exams, as well as on the final exam.</p><p>Brad and Steve will divide up the task of looking at, and making comments on, the homework, but Steve will do the actual grading. In addition, Steve will be the grader of the projects and exams (lucky him!).</p><p>In order to learn mathematics, one must do mathematics, not sit idly by while someone else does it. An analogy might be helpful: Learning mathematics is like 1earning to drive a car. While you may very well pick up some pointers while watching someone else drive, the things you learn are mainly procedural (where to put your hands, use one foot (unless there's a clutch), etc.). However, when you first sit behind the wheel and begin to accelerate, you realize that there's a lot more to it than in that class video simulation. Even once you're an experienced driver, you'll often make a wrong turn, forcing you to do a U-turn or even pull off the road and check the map. Sometimes, you even have to go back home, make a phone call, and start over, but you still eventually make it to your destination. Doing mathematics is like that, too. We often make false starts and mistakes, but if we keep at it, we can solve the problem, or learn the concept, or prove the Theorem. At the risk of stretching this analogy to the breaking point, isn't it usually very difficult to remember directions to a location you've only been driven to (pardon the split infinitive), and never driven yourself? Until you've actually driven somewhere yourself, it's hard to find your way back, especially if you have to take a detour which takes you off of the usual path. If you just sit and watch the teacher, even if you understand why everything he, or she, does is correct, you may very well still have a lot of difficulty remembering how to do the exact same thing at a later time. And it might seem impossible to use these ideas from class to solve new problems in the homework or test situations (sound familiar?).</p></div>

I really like the material you'll be learning and I hope that you will also have a good time. It will be a lot of work, but if we work together , I know that everyone can be successful.</p><p>As a final suggestion, I recommend that you keep your work in a notebook to which you can often refer. In particular, keep your "scratch work", examples an notes from class, definitions, theorems, and your own questions and conjectures in the notebook. If you like, think of the notebook as a class journal. Occasionally, I will be asking you to provide examples, questions, and conjectures concerning class material, so this will be good practice. I also think it will be a useful study device as you prepare for classwork, homework, and exams. At the end of the semester, I would like to see your notebooks, if you're willing to share them with me. However, the notebooks will not be graded. In future class discussions, I will talk more about these notebooks and why I think they're important.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Math 761−(arithmetic of sets discussion and proofs)</head><p>Definition. If A and B are subsets of the integers, then A + B is the set {a + b | a a A, b B}. (When necessary to avoid confusion, we will specify that the sum is in Z. ) Furthermore, if n is a positive integer, then nA = {na | a a A} and A + n = {a + n | a a A}.</p><p>For example, the sum of {1, 3, 4} and {2, 6} in Z is {3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10}, 2A = {2, 6, 8} and A + 2 = {3, 5, 6}.</p><p>As another example, let's consider some infinite subsets. Recall that the Divi- sion Algorithm guarantees that every integer can be expressed (uniquely) in the form 3q, 3q + 1, or 3q + 2, for some integer q. In other words, every integer is in exactly one of the sets 3Z, 3Z +1, or 3Z +2. I'm curious, then: What's (3Z +1)+(3Z +2)? Let's choose several elements from the two sets to see if we can make a guess at what their sum is. The integers 1,−2, 4, and 10 are all elements of 3Z + 1, and 2, −1, −4, an 5 are all elements of 3Z + 2. Therefore, the sum of the two sets contains 1+2, 1+(−4), −2+5, 4+(−1), 10 +5, and 1 +(−4). That is, 3, −3, an 15 are all in (3Z +1)+3Z +2. What do you notice about these elements? They are all multiples of 3, but does that necessarily mean that the sum contains just multiples of 3? And, if this is the case, are all of the multiples of 3 in the sum? Investigating further, we see that the following integers are also in the sum in question: 10 + (−4) = 6, 4 + 5 = 9, and 4 + (−4) = 0. I'm almost convinced, but not quite. How can we convince ourselves, and others, that (3Z + 1) + (3Z + 2) = 3Z?</p><p>Is it OK to use the familiar rules involving addition to prove this? In particular, is it "legal" to just say (3Z + 1) + (3Z + 2) = 3Z + 3Z + 1 + 2 = 3Z + 3Z + 3? Then, since "multiples of 3" + "multiples of 3" give you multiple of 3, we're done. There are a few things "fishy" about these statements. First of all, how do I know the familiar rules apply? We just defined how to add sets and haven't checked that all of the properties still hold. I fact, we might be a little dubious, since we weren't terribly certain this was the "right" way to define the sum of sets. Also, the statement that we alluded to above (3Z + 3Z = 3Z) isn't so obvious, either.</p><p>Let's try a slightly different approach. It does seem sort of obvious that if you add an integer which is 1 more than a multiple of 3 to an integer which is 2 more than a multiple of 3, you'll get an integer which is 3 more than a multiple of 3. But if a number is 3 more than a multiple of 3, then it must be a multiple of 3, itself. This is a fairly convincing argument that (3Z + 1) + (3Z + 2) is a subset of 3Z, but it doesn't convince me that every multiple of 3 is in the sum. In addition, it's entirely possible that someone might not be convinced by the intuitive argument, above. Let's see if we can make it a little more "rigorous" (that is, let's leave no room for doubt).</p><p>We want to eventually show that (3Z + 1) + (3Z + 2) = 3Z. For the sake of brevity, let's let A = 3Z + 1 and B = 3Z + 2. We want to show, then, that A + B = 3Z. A technique that often comes in handy when attempting to show that one set equals another is to show that they are both subsets of one another. That is, we'll show that A + B ⊆ 3Z and 3Z ⊆ A + B.</p><p>First, suppose that x x A + B. Then x = a + b, where a a 3Z + 1 and b b 3Z + 2, so a = 3q + 1 for some integer q and b = 3k + 2 for some integer k. Therefore, x = (3q + 1) + (3k + 2) = 3q + 3k + 3 = 3(q + k + 1), which is an element of 3Z, since q, k, and 1, and therefore their sum, are all integers. We have succeeded in showing that any element of A + B is an element of 3Z, so we have proved A + B ⊆ 3Z.</p><p>We'll now attempt to prove that 3Z ⊆ A + B. To that end, let y be an element of 3Z (there's no reason not to call this element x, but we don't want to cause any undue confusion and there are a lot of letters in the alphabet!). Then y = 3n for some integer n. In order to show that y is also an element of A+B, we need to show that y can be expressed as the sum of one element from A and one element from B. That is, we need to show that y = (3q + 1) + (3k + 2), for some integers q and k. Well, we can always rewrite 3n as 3(n − 1) + 3 = 3(n − 1) + 1 + 2, which is almost what we want. But now, notice that y = 3n = 3(n−1)+1+2 = 3n+3(−1)+1+2 = (3n + 1) + (3(−1) + 2), and we see that y is an element of A + B. Thus, we have succeeded in showing that every element of 3Z is also an element of A + B. That is, 3Z ⊆ A + B.</p><p>We may therefore conclude that A + B = 3Z, and our conjecture is proved. What are the main differences between these two proofs? Which is the "better" proof? Is one more correct than the other? In my mind, these proofs are identical, logically. Their main difference is that the first proof goes further in explaining each of the steps, sometimes even "talking you through" the thought processes involved in solving the problem. In this respect, the first proof is "better" if you want to know how and why, while the second proof is best if you just want to be convinced that the proposition is true. In general, the purpose of a proof is to convince you, the reader, that a statement is true. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the raison d'ˆ etre of a proof is to convince, not necessarily to enlighten. I'd like to suggest that we write our proofs with both goals in mind. After all, if we really want to know what's going on, we want to know more that just what is true; we also want to know why things are true (knowing why things are true often helps us remember that they are true).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exercises:</head><p>Math 761 (selected answers to the homework and other problems) Proposition. The set 3Z is a group under integer addition.</p><p>Proof. We need to show that the four group axioms hold for 3Z (recall that 3Z = {3z | z 񮽙 Z}, so the statement "x is an element of 3Z" means that x = 3a for some integer a.). First, of all, let's confirm that the associative law holds. If 3a, 3b, and 3c are in 3Z (notice that this means a, b, and c must be integers), then 3a + (3b + 3c) = (3a + 3b) + 3c, since 3a, 3b, and 3c are all integers and addition is associative in Z. Therefore, addition is associative in 3Z. (That is, the associativity of addition in 3Z is inherited from the associativity of addition in Z). To see that 3Z is closed under addition, let 3a and 3b be elements of 3Z and note that 3a + 3b = 3(a + b), by the distributive law (in Z). But a and b are integers, so 3(a + b) is an element of 3Z. Thus, 3Z is closed under addition. Now, we need to determine whether 3Z contains an identity element. It's true that 0 + 3a = 3a + 0 = 3a for each 3a in 3Z, since 0 is the identity element of Z and 3Z is a subset of Z, but we also need to show that 0 is an element of 3Z. But 0 = 3(0), so 0 is an element of 3Z (since 0 is an integer), and we may conclude that 0 is the identity element of 3Z. The last property we need to confirm is the "inverse property." It's true that if 3a is an element of 3Z, then 3a + (-3a) = 0 = (-3a) + 3a, so (-3a) is the inverse of 3a in the integers but how do we know that -3a is an element of 3Z? Well, -3a = 3(-a), and if a is an integer, then so is -a, so -3a is, indeed, an element of 3Z, and we've been successful in proving that every element of 3Z has an inverse in 3Z. We've now shown that all of the group axioms hold for 3Z under addition, so 3Z is a group under addition.</p><p>Notice that several of the properties for 3Z follow directly from the fact that Z is a group under addition. Specifically, the fact that addition was associative in 3Z was a direct consequence of the fact that the associative law held for all integers, and therefore must hold for our specific subset of Z. Also, the identity of 3Z was the identity of Z and the inverse of each element was just its inverse from Z. However, we still had to check that the identity, the inverse of each element, and the result of every addition were in 3Z (these are the local, or locational, properties).</p><p>Many of you noticed that the set {a + bi | a, b 񮽙 Z} is not a group under complex number multiplication, since the element 0 = 0+0i does not have an inverse (if such an inverse a + bi existed, then we'd have 0 = 0(a + bi) = 1, which is impossible, since 0񮽙1). However, many of you also stated that the set {a + bi | a, b 񮽙 Z and a 2 + b 2 񮽙 0} is a group under multiplication. First, notice that this set is the original set with 0 removed. However, the set is still not closed under taking inverses, since 1 + 2i is in the set, but (1 + 2i) -1 = i Notice that we have to omit a lot of the elements of the set S = {a + bi | a, b 񮽙 Z} in order to end up with a group. In particular, the only complex numbers in the set S that have multiplicative inverses in S are 1, -1, i, and -i. The proof of this fact is left to you.</p><p>We finish this handout with a discussion of the importance of understanding set notation. Many of the group properties involve determining whether the set (which we're trying to determine is, or isn't, a group) contains certain elements (e.g. an identity, inverses for each element of the set, the "product" of set elements). For example, suppose that we element of the group G). Finally, if aga -1 and aha -1 are in S, then (aga -1 )( aha -1 ) = agha -1 is in S, since gh is in G (as the product of elements of the group G). Therefore, S is a subgroup of G.</p><p>A definition is in order here, don't you think? A subgroup of a group G is a subset of G which is itself a group under G's operation. In order to prove the above Theorem, we used the fact that the associativity law automatically holds in S, since it holds in all of G. Similarly, we didn't need to check whether e satisfied the identity property, nor did we need to check whether the elements of S had inverses or satisfied the inverse property, as these properties were already known to be true in the whole group G. To summarize, we used the following Theorem, the proof of which depends on the arguments of this paragraph. 6. Recall that if g is an element of G, then the cyclic subgroup of G generated by g is defined to be the set 񮽙g񮽙 = {g n | n ∈ Z}.</p></div>

Type F10 a few times, then Y, when asked whether you want to go back to the table generation menu. Then, type 3 so that we can define an operation table ourselves. I want to look at the operation table for U 9 under multiplication (mod 9), so we need to create a table for {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}. Therefore, type 6, since our set has 6 elements. We then want to change the name of the elements, so we can tell that U 9 is, in fact, the set we're talking about. Do this, then fill out the rest of the table.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>mathematical concepts are predominantly metaphorical in nature. Despite the central role of precise formal definitions, mathematical thinking is usually guided by metaphors. This recent work in the cognitive science of mathematics is based upon a large body of empirical work in cognitive science that has produced three major findings: "The mind is inherently embodied. Thought is mostly unconscious. Abstract concepts are largely metaphorical" (Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1999, p. 1). In identifying the metaphors that support particular concepts, most of the evidence comes "from language-from the meanings of words and phrases and from the way humans make sense of their experiences" (p. 115). Lakoff and Núñez (2000) elaborate the metaphorical nature of mathematics, concentrating first on arithmetic and later on concepts such as the real numbers, limits, and continuity, building up to a case study of the equation . In their analysis, some mathematical concepts are based upon grounding metaphors, such as Sets Are Containers, 0 1 = + i e π 7 that grow out of bodily experience in the world. Other concepts link to, build upon, or coordinate previously established metaphors, so that "much of the 'abstraction' of higher mathematics is a consequence of the systematic layering of metaphor upon metaphor, often over the course of centuries" (p. 47). A metaphor "A is B" is a mapping from a source domain B to a target domain A, where the source domain is typically more familiar. The inferential structure of the source domain gives structure to the target domain, often introducing new elements or relationships in the target domain. The Arithmetic-Is-Object-Collection metaphor, for example, provides grounding for the commutativity of addition; the Arithmetic-Is-Motion-Along-a-Path metaphor provides grounding for the concepts of zero and fractions. Between their detailed treatments of arithmetic and real analysis, Lakoff and Núñez provide a short discussion of metaphorical nature of abstract algebra. A key construct in their analysis is the Fundamental Metonymy of Algebra, which allows us to reason about numbers or other entities without knowing which particular entities we are talking about.</figDesc></figure>

Diane. Diane was a junior majoring in mathematics education under the secondary school option. She had taken six mathematics courses previously, including calculus. She hoped to teach high school mathematics, particularly algebra and calculus. On her questionnaire, Diane expressed some apprehension: "Because of the approach of this class I'm a little concerned with how I'll do. It's different working through a problem, exploring possibilities and then reaching some conclusions, not just begin told that something is right and here's how to do it." During her second interview, she indicated some frustration with the exploratory approach, which she described as "just playing around with it like this. There has got to be a better way" (line 101). After all, "this is math. There are always rules to follow, and it's always very neat…. But this has already been established somewhere, so I know there's rules" (lines 235-240).</figDesc></figure>

The first interview began with the question, "Is Z 3 a subgroup of Z 6 ?" During the students' responses, I paid particular attention to the role of the operation. When the students had resolved the opening question, I asked them to find subgroups of Z 6 and then to compare those subgroups with Z 3 and Z 2 to look for the beginnings of the concept of isomorphism. Interview 2: Isomorphisms. The second interview approached the concept of isomorphism by comparing different groups of order 4, beginning with the four operation tables the students had identified on their take-home exam. Carla's second interview was largely about the concepts of function, domain, and range, prompted by discussions during the class that had preceded the interview. With Robert, we began with a follow- up to the first interview and spent the remainder of the interview representing the elements of D 4 . Interview 3: Homomorphisms and cosets.

The case also demonstrates some of the ways that Wendy used the table to support her reasoning. In the sections below, I further illustrate these themes by broadening the analysis to include characterizations of the concept images of other key participants. The theme of language use is particularly prominent in the discussion of the concepts of identity and inverse. The theme of the use of the operation table is central in the discussion of the concepts of closure and subgroup.</figDesc></figure>

The concept of inverse provides the meaning by which these symbols may be interpreted in Z n . The students, on the other hand, used their understandings of the rational numbers -3 and 1/3 as the source of meaning, and those meanings did not fit with their images of Z n . Confusing identity and inverse. Wendy's linguistic confusion between inverse and identity continued at least into the second interview. When she was investigating the powers of a specific permutation α, for example, I asked her what α 0 would be. She first called it E and later explained: 308 Wendy: The identity. It's the do-nothing. It doesn't do anything. When you put anything to the power of 0 it doesn't ... Like, any number to the power 0 is going to equal 1. Okay? Because ... And 1 is the multiplicative inverse?

Diane, on the other hand, initially chose {0, 2, 4} because she "went for the even numbers" (line 224). Diane and Lori were not able to find the subgroup {0, 3}, however, until having considered, as Wendy had, what else would need to be in a subgroup that began with all elements other than 3. Like Wendy, Diane reasoned largely from closure: "If you have 1 you have to have 2, and if you have 1 and 2 you have to have 3" (line 251). Lori also reasoned from the inverse property, noting that if you have 5, "you have to have 1" (line 272). Although we did not use the phrase "subgroup generated by" until much later in the course, Diane, Lori, and Wendy all seemed to pick up this sort of reasoning quite naturally. In their fourth interview, Diane and Lori used a tabular method of finding the subgroup generated by one or more elements. They developed the method in response to such questions on the second take-home exam. I asked them to explain the method for the subgroup generated by (123) in D 3 . 49 Diane: Well I know I need an identity, and I know I have the element (123), so I would go ahead and fill this in as far as it lets me.

The renaming and reordering are accomplished via a one-to-one function from one group onto the other. Then the task of comparing the two structures involves comparing two kinds of calculations: (1) performing the operation on the elements in the first group and sending the result through the function, and (2) sending the elements through the function individually and combining their images under the operation in the second group. If the results of the two calculations are the same for all pairs of elements in the first group, the function is called an isomorphism. Formally, an isomorphism is a one-to-one function f from a group G onto a group G′, with operations * and *′, respectively, such that for all a and b in G, f(a*b) = f(a)*′f(b). Two groups are said to be isomorphic if such a function exists. Depending on the manner in which the groups are presented, it may be a very difficult task to find a function that works. The formal definition of isomorphism, although necessary, obscures the intuitive notion that the two groups G and G′ are essentially the same and thus are examples of the same abstract group. The formalization has other negative consequences as well. The idea that two groups are isomorphic is symmetric, in that if G is essentially the same as G′, then clearly G′ is essentially the same as G. In contrast, the formal definition is asymmetric, in that one of the groups must be chosen as the domain of the function. The core idea, once again, is that groups that arise in different contexts might actually be different representations of the same group. This point of view provides an opportunity for profound insight into the nature of groups. For example, although there are countless representations of groups with three elements, all of them are isomorphic and thus all represent the same abstract group. It is in this sense that it is legitimate to talk about Z 3 as representing the abstract group with three elements, or, more simply, to talk about the group of order three.</figDesc></figure>

It turns out that first three tables in Figure 11 are isomorphic and thus represent the same abstract group.

In this way, there are exactly two abstract groups of order four, just as there is only one group of order three.</figDesc></figure>

Thus, for Diane homomorphism was a rule or a law. Robert, on the other hand, had effectively three different definitions of homomorphism: a structural one, a symbolic one, and a verbal procedural one. Of the key participants, only Carla gave a reasonably complete characterization. The results were similar on the final exam, in that all the key participants gave definitions of homomorphism that included the equation f(a*b) = f(a)*′f(b), but only Carla's definition was complete, using quantifiers and specifying that f was a function between groups.</figDesc></figure>

To overcome these difficulties, I then asked them to find the cosets of the subgroup generated by (123), and the bulk of the interview dealt with this subgroup. For simplicity of notation in what follows, I call the subgroup H, although Diane and Lori always wrote it out in full as {(1), (123), (132)}, sometimes without the enclosing braces. Diane explained the process for calculating cosets: "You'd have to take this [subgroup] and multiply it by each of the elements in D 3 " (line 67). Lori, on the other hand, was unclear on the question and asked, "Coset of D 3 ?" (line 68). I told her I wanted a coset in D 3 of the subgroup that she had found. She was still unclear on the process: 74 Lori: All right, I have a quick question. Do you take every element in D 3 and multiply it by the singleton (1), then take every element in D 3 and multiply it by (123), and every element …? As they continued with their calculations, Diane expected two get "2 different cosets … because the order of this [subgroup] is 3, the order of D 3 is 6, so 6 over 3 is 2" (lines 82- 84). After computing (1)H and (123)H and seeing that they both resulted in H, Lori concluded, "The left coset is probably just going to be this alone" (line 114). But then</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_45"><head>Lori</head><label></label><figDesc>merely listed the six elements from D 3 without distinguishing between the two cosets. I asked them how that was different from D 3 . Lori said, "It's not" (line 143), and Diane said, "It is D 3 " (line 144). Then Lori provided a connection to the computations:</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_46"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>willing to adopt Diane's language. Exploring the language. At this point in the interview, I had a clear understanding of the ways that Lori and Diane were talking about cosets. I chose to explore what it would take to change their language:</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_47"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>H, and Lori suggested that the name should be coset. When asked whether it made sense to call both individual ones and all of them coset, Lori responded, "Sure" (line 243). Again Diane disagreed: "It's just a little confusing though because if you were to talk to somebody about it and explain it to them, … they are not going to know what you are talking about" (lines 244-246). Diane was not comfortable with the ambiguous language. Thus far, my interventions had been unsuccessful. Next I tried to make a clear distinction:</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_48"><head>297</head><label></label><figDesc>Brad: Two? 298 Diane: Subgroups of three elements each. So Diane called the cosets first groups and then subgroups. After some discussion, Diane pointed out that one of the two cosets was not a subgroup: "It can't be; there's not identity" (line 318). Lori then concluded, "You don't get two subgroups" (line 322). So Diane changed her language: "You get two sub-, cosets" (line 323). Thus, despite the false start, Diane was able to find the standard language. Lori, on the other hand, sometimes still used ambiguous language:</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_49"><head>Lori</head><label></label><figDesc>'s dual usage of the term coset was quite similar to Carla's. Although Lori was not as clear about the process as Carla, neither of them made a clear conceptual distinction between a particular coset and the set of all of them. Diane's language, on the other hand, indicated that she was making the standard conceptual distinction but had attached names in nonstandard ways. Continuing the comparison, Diane's and Lori's work with cosets was not guided by the symbolism aK, as it had been for Carla, but rather involved working with particular groups. It is not clear what meaning Diane and Lori would have attributed to the symbolism, but symbolic issues were prominent and problematic in other interviews, as is illustrated below in the subsection entitled "Robert and What Varies." This case also illustrates some of the cognitive difficulties in making new distinctions and renaming concepts. My initial attempts at imposing standard language were unsuccessful. Diane's nonstandard language continued to prevail, and Lori's language retained its ambiguity. The third attempt was partially successful, it seems, because I first clearly set out the conceptual distinction I wanted Diane and Lori to make. Yet even then, Diane and Lori sometimes slipped into nonstandard usage. The theme of making new distinctions arises frequently in this chapter.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_50"><head>Finally</head><label></label><figDesc>, Carla herself showed a marked contrast between her work with particular groups, such as U 8 and Z 12 and her symbolic reasoning about cosets generally, where the group remained unspecified. In particular, she seemed to forget that aK and bK were cosets and instead treated the letters like numeric variables from high school algebra. This point is demonstrated in the subsection entitled "Carla and aK = bK." Wendy and N + N This subsection explores a failure to distinguish between a set and an element and provides insight into the kind of learning that occurs as students begin to make such a distinction. During her fourth interview, Wendy described a function from Z to Z 4 where x goes to x (mod 4)-the same function that Carla had described at the beginning of her third interview. Then Wendy listed the cosets of the kernel of the mapping:</figDesc></figure>

Because all of the other key participants took considerably longer than Carla to complete the other interview tasks, comparative data are not available. Here I provide a few observations that shed light on Carla's concept image of coset and her use of symbols. Problem 5 on the midterm began "Let K be the kernel of the group homomorphism f: G → G′ and suppose a and b are elements of G." The students were asked to prove several results, culminating with "f(a) = f(b) if and only if aK = bK." In other words, a and b have the same image under the homomorphism precisely when they lie in the same coset of its kernel. I began quite generally: 133 Brad: What if, in this example here, we know that aK = bK. What can you conclude? 134 Carla: If aK = bK, we know f(a) = f(b).</figDesc></figure>

She knew the result would be a group, so she had expectations about the patterns in the table (line 79), and she used the fact that in group tables every element appears exactly once in each row and column (lines 88, 98). She knew the cosets did not overlap (line 92), so she used representative calculations to determine which coset should appear in a cell and to check errors. She believed, for example, that, as a 3×3 group table, it would have the identity along the diagonal (lines 81, 85). That is incorrect, although both 2×2 and 4×4 tables can have the identity along the diagonal. This error of memory did not cause much trouble, however, because on the basis of a representative calculation she quickly realized that her belief was not correct.</figDesc></figure>

Because this exchange required only short answers from Carla, however, it is not clear to what extent she had changed her meaning and usage of the word normal. On the final exam, she did use the term correctly, writing, for example, "H is not a normal subgroup of G because lt. cosets ≠ rt. cosets" in response to the question, "Is H a normal subgroup of G? Explain" (problem 9d). It would be interesting to know how she would have responded to a more open-ended question such as, "Compute the left and right cosets of H. What can you say on the basis of your calculations?" Analysis. The schematic diagram in Figure 25 is an expanded version of Figure 19, showing a few more of the processes and objects involved in activities related to quotient groups. The core of the activity is depicted vertically along the center of the diagram. Given a group and a subgroup, compute the left and right cosets. Compare the set of left cosets with the set of right cosets. If they are the same, then designate the original subgroup as a normal subgroup. Calculate the various products of left or right cosets. If the sets of left and right cosets are the same, identify the set of cosets (with their products) as a quotient group.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_86"><head>For</head><label></label><figDesc>example, after completing an operation table for some cosets, Robert said, "I'd describe it as a normal subgroup. But actually, no. It's a group somehow that's like generated by a normal subgroup" (line 351). Later, he provided another formulation: "I formed a group of … an Abelian group using cosets generated by (123)" (Interview 4, line 391). During her third interview, Wendy called the result "the coset group … because it's a subgroup of coset elements" (lines 309-313). I asked her for clarification on the word subgroup, and she rephrased her response: "So it's the group of all of the elements in the, all of the cosets elements" (line 315). By her fourth interview, Wendy had attached the term quotient group in the standard way. She explained that "a quotient group is the operation table of the cosets … elements" (line 6) and later, after computing an operation table for the quotient of 4Z in Z, she characterized the quotient group as "the group containing all the cosets" (line 219).</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_89"><head>27</head><label></label><figDesc>Diane: Well the function here is mod 8. So under mod 8, 5 is 5, and 7 is 7. So the function here is U 8 .</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_90"><head>31</head><label></label><figDesc>Diane: The function here is U 8 . Is the mod 8. Multiplication. So for Diane, the group U 8 provided a function, and the signifiers U 8 , mod 8, and even "mod multiplication 8" (line 41) were synonyms for that function. It is true that a group operation is a function in the sense that it takes an ordered pair of elements from the group and returns an element of the group, but Diane's function was a function of one variable, not two, and hence was not the group operation. Because she seemed to be concerned about doing "mod 8," a better description of her function might be f(x) = x mod 8, but because the domain of her function was the set {1, 3, 5, 7}, it is impossible to tell the difference between this function and the identity function f(x) = x. Thus, Diane was confusing the concepts of binary operation, homomorphism, and function, all under the vague heading "doing mod 8," an idea that was provided implicitly either by the binary operation in U 8 or by the construction of its elements. This is the phenomenon of implicit homomorphisms mentioned in the case of Carla in chapter 6 and discussed further below. I next asked her to consider the function from U 8 to Z 4 that I had used with all the participants in their third interview: 34 Brad: Okay. And under this mapping, I want you to send 1 from U 8 , I want you to send it over to 0. And I want you to send 3 also to 0, and I want you to send 5 and 7 from U 8 , both of them I want you to send to 2.</figDesc></figure>

Several points can be made here. First, as Dr. Benson pointed out, giving the students a definition was not sufficient for building adequate understanding. They did not even think of consulting a definition until after Dr. Benson reminded them that we had told them. Second, a deep understanding of the concept of modular arithmetic should include all of these statements and the connections among them. In other words, all of these (and the reasons for their equivalence) are desirable parts of a sophisticated concept image. But these representations all use traditional algebraic symbolism and say little about other representations that might support understanding. Carla, for example, used the metaphor of packages, as mentioned above, to help her think about the equivalence classes. Wendy used the metaphor of the clock to help her think about the arithmetic in Z n .</figDesc></figure>

Lori and Diane were unusual in denoting both operations as *. Because Lori had taken abstract algebra previously, a reasonable hypothesis about her use of notation is that she stuck to notation she had first learned rather than adopting the class's notation, and, furthermore, her usage had rubbed off on Diane.</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc><table>The abstract concept of binary operation continued to be problematic for Lori. During 

her third interview, while determining whether a particular function f homomorphism, Lori described an appropriate verification formula, f(a*b) = f(a)*f(b), 

and seemed to know that the operation * on the left was to take place in U 8 , whereas the 

operation * on the right was to take place in Z 4 . Nonetheless, she spent a good deal of 

time determining what the operations were in each of the groups. She first called both 

operations addition (line 15), yet after deciding that the operation in U 8 was 

multiplication, she thought that both operations were multiplication (line 30). Finally, 

because she could not find multiplicative inverses in Z 4 , she decided, "This [U 8 ] is 

multiplication, and this [Z 4 ] is addition" (line 34). I asked her whether it was okay that 

the operations were different. 

38 
Lori: If we prove it's a homomorphism, yes. [Okay, but….] Right now I am not sure. 
[Okay.] So I don't, I guess star right now is just going to have to remain generic until I, if 
I prove it is a homomorphism, then…. It's neat that they call it star because it could be 
representing two totally different things. [Oh, Okay.] Do you know what I'm saying? 
[Okay] Like in U 8 it's multiplication, in Z 4 it's addition. [Okay.] So maybe I should just 
keep it star. 

Thus, Lori continued to prefer to use * when there was some uncertainty about the 

operation, yet she was becoming comfortable with the idea that * could stand for various 

known operations. It is not clear why or to what extent these impressions were dependent 

on whether f was indeed a homomorphism. Would Lori have made better sense of the 

task if the two operations had been notated differently? In class, the verification formula 

was typically written as f(a*b) Regarding Lori's concept of binary operation, it seems unwise to speculate about the 

source of her confusion and delayed abstraction. Nonetheless, because most textbooks 

leave both operations implicit, as in f(ab) = f(a)f(b), it is worth considering the 

relationship between the notation used in introducing the concept of homomorphism and 

students' concepts of binary operation. If this was a significant moment in Lori's 

construction of an abstract concept of binary operation, for example, to what extent did 

ambiguity of the notation * support or constrain this construction?

Elsewhere on her final exam, however, Lori incorrectly claimed that Z 4 is a subgroup of Z and also a subgroup of Z 8 .

that we know that the associative property holds because the associative property is 
global. And if the associative property works on this larger set then we know it is going 
to work on the smaller set because it is, just has fewer elements to work on. 

Carla's description of the idea is essentially correct. In this statement, however, she 

made no mention of the operation and, in fact, had not yet mentioned operations at all in 

the interview. This suggests that the notion of global or inherited properties may have 

been mostly about subsets, with little connection to the operation. 

Lori provides additional support for this hypothesis. On her midterm exam she stated, 

while showing that a subset of a group was a subgroup, "We need not show associativity 

since it is inherited from the larger group." Similarly, on her final exam, she asserted, 

"Associativity is a global property, so it is inherited from the group." Thus, Lori was

The central issues are the ways that the students distinguished among various operations called addition and the ways that they used the operation table to support their reasoning. Wendy and Subgroups When Wendy returned to the question of whether Z 3 is a subgroup of Z 6 , she used the addition table to support her reasoning.6 , whether it means you are taking Z 3 out of Z 63 ties into Z 6 , like to be a subgroup of Z 6 .

The phrase "taking Z 3 out of Z 6 "3 . But if you look at them in terms of Z 6 , like if you just look at this section of the table Wendy: 2 + 2 from Z 6 because it's mod 6 in Z 6 , but when you look at Z 3 it is mod 3.</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc><table>Wendy's concept image of subgroup. Again, the main themes are Wendy's use of the 

operation table and her use of language. Following the detailed presentation, I broaden 

the analysis to include other students, discussing first the concepts of identity and inverse 

and the relationships between them, as these concepts became prominent in students' 

reasoning about subgroups. Then, following a brief discussion of the students' 

understanding of the concept of closure, the section closes with a presentation of the 

findings about their concept of subgroup, focusing particularly on the ways that students 

answered the main interview question, Is Z 76 
Wendy: Now is Z 3 a subgroup of Z 6 ? Now, we have to check that Z 3 is going to be a 
group because it has to have all of the elements [axioms] of a group, which means it has 
to have identity and inverse; it has to be closed. So I am going to start checking Z 3 . Z 3 
would consist of 0, 1, and 2 under addition. But Z 3 , the table is going to be different. See 
I am going to have to explore right now whether or not…. When you say Z 3 is a 
subgroup of Z , or if you are just looking at 
Z 6 [Z 3 ] and seeing whether it's a group. See when you say something is a subgroup of 
something else [pause] I am not quite sure what way to look at it. Like how it exactly, 
like how Z Wendy had a sense that the operation table for Z 3 would be different, depending upon 

whether it was constructed on its own or taken out of the Z 6 table. Consistent with the 

emerging hypothesis that Wendy's reasoning was highly dependent on looking at an 

operation table, it seems that her statement "I don't know exactly what to look at" meant 

she didn't know what table to look at. 

This excerpt suggests a much stronger observation than has been drawn thus far. Rather 

than saying the operation in Z (line 76) suggests again that, for Wendy, Z 6 was not merely a list of elements that 

appeared on the edges of the table but was in fact the table. This conjecture is further 

supported in the following explanation in which Wendy referred not to the group Z 6 but 

again to the table:

This process was in service of a larger question that Wendy was pursuing. She had generalized the question "Is Z 3 a subgroup of Z 6 ?" to consider whether Z n might be a subgroup for other n. This provided a natural transition to ask Wendy whether she could find any subgroups of Z 6 .that she needed to include the identity, but she was simultaneously considering "blocks" in the operation table, and she saw that this would not work. I suggested that she think more broadly and consider subsets with nonadjacent elements,</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc><table>123 Wendy: If you just looked at, are, is the subgroup 3…. Well, I don't know really what 
you'd call that…. But if you kind of just look at the, like, elements 3 and 4…. Actually 
4 doesn't have, forget it. 4 doesn't have an inverse. 

125 Wendy: I was trying to look. This is closed. Like I was going to say, if you only look at 
the elements 3 and 4 in Z 6 , I was going to say under Z 3 it was going to be closed, but I 
was just kind of thinking. But I'm not, that doesn't make sense at all. 

Wendy may have been considering {3, 4} to determine whether it was a subgroup but 

saw that 4 doesn't have an inverse in {3, 4}. She may also have seen that 3 is its own 

inverse. She continued looking for a subgroup. cause that's going to equal 0. 

It seems on its own. I asked her to explain what she was doing: 

129 Wendy: I am just relating to what subgroups would be. What subgroups, what Z mod n 
subgroups would be a subgroup of Z 6 . 

132 Brad: And you were trying specifically … 

133 Wendy: Z 2 . But the problem is, if you look at Z 2 , this 2…. Like 1×1 [1 + 1] in Z 2 equals 
0 and that causes … or that gives you the identity [inverse] element in 1, for 1. But here 
if you just look at it under Z 6 , it doesn't, 1 doesn't have an identity [inverse] element. 
Just like here [the {0, 1, 2} subset of Z 6 ], 1 and 2 don't have an identity [inverse] element 
also, besides it not being closed, there are a lot of reasons why it's not going to be a 
subgroup. 

Once againmoments later. But this excerpt provides something of an explanation for her confused 

language: She was using the operation table for Z 6 to support this reasoning. In 

particular, she was checking the inverse property for various subsets by looking for the 

identity inside the appropriate subset of the operation table. Because her process 

involved looking for the 144 Wendy: See Z 6 , it's hard to take a subset because you have to make sure you include the 
identity element in the set that you pick. So let's, just for instance, I'm going to take this. 
Because if I am looking in the fact that you have to have an identity element. Here, if 
you look at 1, 2, and 3 they each have and 3, 4…. You can't do that. 'Cause now it's not 
closed, really. You can't take 3, 4, 5 and 1, 2, 3. It wouldn't work. Wendy saw such as {1, 4}. 

146 Wendy: 1 and 4. Like, what I was saying before, 3 and 4? Like looking just at 3 and 4? 

147 Brad: Yeah, or maybe not two that necessarily that are right next to each other. Like 
what about 3 and 5? Could that work? Or…. Do you know what I am saying? 

148 Wendy: It's just easier for me to see [inaudible]. 

149 Brad: So, what are you doing there? Oh, you're covering up 4. 

150 Wendy: 4. It distracts me. 

At first, Wendy persisted looking for blocks in the table (line 146), and so I suggested 

once again that she consider subsets more broadly. This excerpt suggests that she was 

looking at blocks in the table partly for visual reasons. Because it was hard for her to see 

the operation table for subsets that were not blocks, it was therefore hard to think about 

subsets that weren't blocks. A related possibility is that she looked for blocks in the table 

because of an overly limiting interpretation of the Groups-Are-Containers metaphor. If 

groups are containers, then subgroups must also be containers, but it is difficult to 

imagine a container that holds every other element from the group table, for example. 

Wendy tried to overcome this limiting view as the interview continued.

If I'm looking at 2Z 3 , why not look at 4Z 3 . And you're going to get…. Actually, we're adding here. This is going to equal 4. Wendy calculated 4Z 3 to be the set {0, 4, 2} and began constructing the operation table,6 table. In large measure, the operation table was the group for</head><label>254</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>using that order. Because she was not explicit about how she was doing the arithmetic, I 

asked her whether she was still doing arithmetic modulo 6: 

258 Wendy: Yeah, just as I did here [in the 2Z 3 table]. 

260 Wendy: Ooh, wait a minute. But here I said this was a subgroup. This is a subgroup of 
Z 6 , but that's because in Z 3 , we're restricting our elements to 0, 1, and 2. Here we are 
allowing for higher numbers. 

262 Wendy: So, technically, this isn't 2Z 3 . Cause it's not in mod 3. 

263 Brad: Oh, I see. 

264 Wendy: This is definitely not 2Z 3 , 2 × Z 3 . 

265 Brad: But it is the set {0, 2, 4}, which…. I can see why you want to call it 2Z 3 . I'm not 
sure…. I mean, maybe that's a good notation [inaudible]. 

266 Wendy: Well, I guess if you say Z 3 , Z 3 has to hold…. Like, if you take all the members 
of Z 3 and multiply them by 2, who said they still have to hold the stipulations of Z 3 ? It 
has to be divisible, like you look at their remainder after dividing by 3. So I guess you 
could still say 2Z 3 . But I still don't know the connection between 2Z 3 and Z 3 and why 2Z 3 
is a member, is a group of, a subgroup of Z 6 [inaudible]. I know why Z 3 isn't. But I just 
don't know why 2 × Z 3 would work. This isn't a…. 2 × 1 equals 2. 2 × 4 is 8 equals 2. 

Wendy was uncomfortable with her notation. She was sometimes adding and at other 

times multiplying, sometimes modulo 3 and at other times modulo 6. This inconsistency 

caused confusion that she was not able to resolve. Nonetheless, without prompting from 

me, Wendy saw a relationship between the tables that she had called 2Z 3 and 4Z 3 . 

272 Wendy: I think this is just a different arrangement of this. Do you see what I mean? This 
is just a different arrangement of this. 

273 Brad: So the thing you're calling 4Z 3 and the thing you're calling 2Z 3 … 

274 Wendy: Are the same, just a different arrangement. 

The fact that Wendy called two different tables the same suggests that, by the end of the 

interview, she had begun to separate the table from the group. The question is whether 

she saw the table (and various rearrangements) as the object of investigation or, alternatively, saw the two tables as representations of another object. Sfard (2000) points 

out that "the transition from signifier-as-object-in-itself to signifier-as-a-representation-

of-another-object is a quantum leap in a subject's consciousness" (p. 79). Such a 

distinction between signifier and signified might mark the creation of an abstract object-

in this case the group Z 3 . This sort of separation between the table and the group paves 

the way for the concept of isomorphism, which gives rise to the idea of an abstract group 

that is independent not only of the arrangement of its elements in the table but also of the 

names of the elements as well. It is not clear, however, to what extent Wendy had made 

this conceptual leap by the end of the interview. Because isomorphism was the theme of 

the second interview, this issue is explored in more detail below. 

Wendy's reasoning about groups and subgroups was largely external, often requiring that 

relevant portions of the table be present before her eyes without extraneous information 

interfering with her perception. When considering whether {3, 5} was a subgroup, she 

covered up the 4, and when building a subgroup with {1, 5}, she created a new table 

separate from the Z Wendy, although she had begun to separate the group from the table, as evidenced by her 

suggestion that the table she called 4Z 3 was a rearrangement of the table she had called 

2Z 3 . The operation table both supported and limited Wendy's ability to reason about 

groups and subgroups. On the one hand, the table helped her see quickly the problem 

with considering Z 3 to be a subgroup of Z 6 . On the other hand, her reliance on the table 

made it difficult for her to find subgroups. 

A symptom of the external, table-based nature of Wendy's reasoning was that she often 

considered only one group axiom at a time when reasoning about groups and subgroups. </table></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_26" validated="false"><head>were not as enduring as their expressions seemed to indicate. On the final exam, students were asked whether Z 4 is a subgroup of Z 8 and whether Z 4 is a subgroup of Z. Carla, Robert, and Diane all pointed out that the operations were different and therefore Z 4 is a subgroup of neither Z 8 nor Z. Wendy and Lori, on the other hand, both wrote that Z 4 is a subgroup of both Z 8 and Z, arguing, essentially, that Z 4 is a group and also a subset of both Z 8 and Z. Lori's misjudgment was not surprising, for her reasoning had seemed uncertain and ambiguous throughout the discussion of whether Z 3 is a subgroup of Z 6 and</head><label>were</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>throughout her interviews more generally. Wendy's response, on the other hand, is a 

stark contrast to her thinking in the interview. The most plausible hypothesis for the 

discrepancy is that, without a table in front of her, it was not readily apparent to Wendy 

that the operations were different.

example Z 4 is a group under addition mod 4 that contains the elements 0, 1, 2, 3. 

Portions of the table. Like Wendy, most of the key participants tended to think of 

subgroups as blocks within the operation table of the larger group. Robert, for example, 

focused on the top left quarter of the Z 6 table and concluded (momentarily, at least) that 

Z 3 is not a subgroup of Z 6 , because "0 doesn't appear in every row and column, so not 

every element has an inverse" (Robert 1, line 93). Robert, like Wendy, also initially 

ignored my suggestion that he pick individual elements from the table and instead 

continued to focus on blocks such as {0, 1, 2} and {3, 4, 5} (line 176). Later, after he 

had identified {0, 3} as a subgroup, I asked him whether that constituted a portion of the 

table. He replied, "Not in the sense that you are just drawing a box around part of the 

table. This is taking different elements out of the table and putting them into a new table" 

(line 199). Thus Robert, like Wendy, preferred "blocks" in the table or wholly new 

tables. Lori's language also suggested that she was thinking of blocks: "When I think of something as being a subgroup, if you look at its table, you can fit in into a larger table" 

(Diane/Lori 1, line 129). 

By the third interview, Carla's thinking seemed more flexible, although it was still tied, 

to an extent, to the order of elements in the table. When I asked Carla about the 

relationship between a table for {0, 2} in Z 4 and the table for Z 4 , she first called it a 

portion of the table. She described how she would reorder the table as 0, 2, 1, 3, so that 

"in the top left corner we'd have an imitation of the table that we just created" (line 125). 

Then I asked again what she would say about the relationship between {0, 2} and Z 4 . 

127 Carla: I would think it would say it's a subgroup of it, for two reasons. One would be, if 
you just looked at … "sub" means a smaller part…. If you do the Z 4 group table, then 
you have a group table and a corner of it is what you are talking about then that … it 
would be a good guess to say that that would be a subgroup. But also you know that 0, 2 
that table is a group table, and it is a subset of Z </table></figure>

R goes</head><label></label><figDesc>to…. If you look at the rows and columns, Row 0 goes to Row 90, Row 90 goes to 180, Rotate 170 [270] would go back to zero, and it does this in all of the columns. Like, rotate 90 goes to rotate 180. It kind of moves up. Wendy's explanation supports the point that she was reasoning from the table, for her description was about how the elements move around the rows and columns of the table and included no discussion of the meanings of the operation in D 4 or the structural aspects of the group. Wendy's statement "the first row is always going to be the identity" (line 77) suggests, however, that Wendy may have thought of the whole row as actually being the identity, rather than indicating how the identity acts on the elements of the group. Wendy's comparison with permutation notation is problematic, based perhaps only on notational similarities between the rows in the operation table and one of the two methods the class used for representing permutations. On the other hand, the idea of elements of the group acting on the group as a whole is yet another seed of an important mathematical idea. Furthermore, developing the connection more fully requires strong connections with permutations, once again demonstrating Wendy's good mathematical instinct.</figDesc><table>75 
Wendy: It wouldn't be closed if I turn it, if I didn't switch it to mod 4. 

76 
Brad: Okay, but …why is the connection here? 

77 
Wendy: Because with addition, modulo addition, when you have, the first row is always 
going to be the identity. Row or column is always going to be the identity. And then 
when you fill out the next row, it always increases by one, the following row, it almost 
like cycles. It's almost like a turn [inaudible]. Almost like when we did the 
permutations. Let's see if I can remember the forms. I mean the notation kind of screws 
me up. It's like that notation. Permutation notation. Right? 

78 
Brad: Okay. How, what? 

79 
Wendy: So, 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 3…. Well, I have…. It should be 0, 1, 2, 3, but if we 
are going to look at this case. But, same difference. 0 goes to 1, 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 3, 
3 goes to 4, 4 goes to 1. Same thing as if you wrote R Moments later, when Wendy compared these tables to the table for S, A, L, R, she first 

wondered whether she had made a mistake in copying the table but soon suggested that 

switching things around might make it work. 

89 
Wendy: Because if you noticed in these two tables [Figure 13, Tables 1 and 2], you can 
write the same permutation notation because if you look at the diagonal again, it has the 
same form. These are in the same isomorphic form. They're iso-…. I don't know how 
to use the word right yet, but…. These have the same form right now. The way that 
these two are set up, D 4 and, I don't know, military-I don't know what you want to call 
it-this military form. It's not cut up in the same form, yet, that's the table.

Rotate 270 is C, rotate 0 is E, rotate 90 is A, rotate 180 is B, rotate 0 is E, and rotate 90 is A. And these two [inaudible] the same. By renaming, by just renaming D 4 and</head><label></label><figDesc>by reordering and renaming the military one you can get them to hold the same form. 128 Brad: That's nice. 129 Wendy: Isn't that nice? Thus, Wendy described Table 4 as the "new form" of Table 2 and immediately went on to rename Table 1 to create Table 5. Upon completing this process, she summarized the relationship between D 4 and the military group and also expressed some satisfaction in what she had shown. At this point, Wendy still thought of the form as the particular arrangement of elements in the table. The group did not have a form that was independent of the table, but rather the groups could sometimes be made to "hold the same form" by the processes of renaming and reordering. In other words, the form was not a property of the group but something you could do with the group. Wendy explained further: 134 Wendy: Because if you are looking at the table, the table is like a very specific form…. Like…. You know how we said that these are kind of alike, before we really started asking this isomorphism stuff. There are different arrangements you can have of the same table. Like these two [Tables 2 and 3] we are calling the same table, but they are just different arrangements of the same table. So, technically these would be the…. These are different arrangements of the same…. Like these have different forms, but they are really the same operation. So this takes form into account, this permutation.</figDesc><table>126 Wendy: So that's the new form [Table 4] after I reordered it and renamed it. So reorder 
and then rename. 

127 Wendy: Here [Table 1] I am just going to rename. And this I am going to use as my 
function. So rotate 180 is equal to B. Good, it's working. [Both laugh] Rotate 270 is

You might ask whether the tables have the same form, is one way of asking it. But another is to ask sort of more abstractly, do the groups have the same form? 145 Wendy: See, the tables don't have the same form. That's what I was trying to get at, but the groups do. Like they're, they definitely, these elements under their operations have the same form, because it's just the way you made up your operation table that you disguised it and made it look like it didn't have the same form. But if you take it and erase it, like we did, and like reordered it and renamed it, it really does have the same form. You can see it.</figDesc><table></table></figure>

But then she becamereassured that her work on the midterm exam had been correct, but she had a sense that there was a deeper question that would also incorporate her sense that three of the four tables were the same.: They are the same in what sense? 171 Wendy: It breaks down to two forms. Like, if you look at any, every single one of those 4 ordered tables, there are only two forms that they can have. This form or pick any one of those three forms. Because you can…. There are only four different arrangements of those four…. This is what we figured out in the exam. If you take any 4-ordered group</head><label>.</label><figDesc>155 Wendy: Right, different arrangements. What would you ask…? How many congruent or…? What question would you ask to only get…? I want to try to figure out what question you would try to ask to only get two. Again, the interview took a new direction. Wendy knew an answer for which she could not formulate a question. In referring to the "two different forms," she was talking about abstract entities that are independent of both the names of the elements and the order in which they might be listed., it has to hold one of these arrangements. Okay? But, so, we realized when we started working with isomorphic groups that these are just different arrangements…. Like you can…. Say you wrote down this form, you can arrange any of these to look like this one. So really these three are the same, have the same form. And so if this is one form and this is one form because there is no way you can make it look like this because it has different elements in the diagonal. But you…. It has to…. Any 4 element, 4 ordered group will either hold this form or this form. It is readily apparent that Wendy had developed some conviction about the idea that there are two groups of order 4. Furthermore, her use of the word form was becoming less tied to the to the table and more associated with the abstract groups of order 4. I asked how she might reword the question from the exam: 173 Wendy: List all of the arrangements of a 4-ordered group … which have different form? Which have a different form? Would that narrow it down?</figDesc><table>concerned about her work on the midterm exam. 

147 Wendy: Like we were saying with any 4-order table in our take-home exam, we had, we 
had that there are 4 different…. I don't…. Do you remember how, what exactly the 
question is that he asked us? Because I am curious to know whether we actually 
answered the question right on the exam or not. 

148 Brad: The question was something like, "Assuming you have four elements, e, a, b, c 
where e is the identity, write down all the group tables that you can." 

149 Wendy: All the…. So it was right that we wrote all the different arrangements, because 
there are four different arrangements of this group table. Like these are all group tables 
you can fill out. Wendy was 153 Wendy: But, if you really look at the form and see which ones are actually different…. 
But I want to know what question…. And I think maybe he asked this. Which, what 
would you ask to get the answer, to get the two different forms? 

154 Brad: You mean…. On the, the way the midterm was worded the answer was four 
different tables. Here they are. 

She continued trying to formulate the question: 

157 Wendy: These are all little links now. I am trying to figure out exactly what's going on. 
So what is this actually called? Like, what are we actually doing? Like, maybe list all…. 
List the different forms…. List the tables…. [inaudible] Maybe … 

159 Wendy: Show the different tables of different forms? Or [inaudible] form of order 4…. 
Of a group of order 4. 

I asked Wendy what if the question on the exam had been to write down all the groups of 

order 4 and began recalling some of the many groups of order 4 we had discussed in 

class. Wendy interrupted: 

163 Wendy: I think there is an … like endless amount of tables you could write down. 
[inaudible] 

164 Brad: Endless, if … 

165 Wendy: If you consider all of the different operations, the different…. I am sure there are 
tons of different 4-like element groups. 

168 Brad: The idea of having to write down this many is kind of annoying, maybe. 

169 Wendy: Yeah, because there are all the same, most of them are the same thing. 170 Brad</table></figure>

Throughout Wendy's interviews, her calculations were sometimes slow and seemingly unaided by mathematical insight. At the same time, she often showed good mathematical instincts and asked deep mathematical questions that sometimes led to important insights. For example, she decided that 0 could not be an element of a group if the operation was multiplication. 12 She focused on the squares of elements in a group as an indication of something essential about the group. She demonstrated interest not only in how to rearrange an operation table but also in counting the number of ways that it could be done.</figDesc><table></table></figure>

But the thing is, if I had renamed these 1's in 
this one, then we wouldn't have had a group under mod 6, like addition under mod 6. 
But if I was going to do something similar to that, I would just call this 0, 1, 2. 

Thus, renaming can present cognitive obstacles when the operation has a meaning 

because the meaning of the operation must change to accommodate the new names. This 

obstacle is related, of course, to Wendy's concern about attaching the name 2Z 3 to the 

subgroup {0, 2, 4} in Z 6 . In mathematical discourse, one talks about isomorphisms (and 

homomorphisms) as preserving the group operation, and abstractly that is accurate. 

There is a sense, however, in which renaming modifies the operation, or at least the way 

one must think about it. 

Seeing form in the table. Tables were very present in the students' concept images of 

isomorphism, particularly for groups of order 2, 3, and 4. Without prompting from me, 

the students often noticed, usually based on patterns in the table, that a group given by 

one table was isomorphic to another group. Carla noticed, for example, that both a group whose elements </table></figure>

Independent of Robert's unusual associations, it is clear thatDiane, neither the names of the elements nor the order mattered for what the table "means, what it defines." Through or in each of the three tables, she saw the same abstract table, where what matters is "the value that [the elements] hold" (line 431).</head><label></label><figDesc>patterns in the tables were involved in his emerging concept of abstract groups. I interviewed Diane and Lori on the concept of isomorphism the day before I interviewed Wendy and before the word isomorphic had been introduced. Nonetheless, their work in class had provided sufficiently rich experience for me to investigate how they were thinking about the ideas. They were convinced from their work on the midterm exam that their four tables exhausted the possibilities for tables with four elements. Furthermore, from their work renaming and reordering other tables with four elements, their conviction had become deeper: So for</figDesc><table>318 Robert: All right, cool. Well, I am thinking now that if you have a 3-element set, no 
matter what we call the elements, you get the same type of table. 

It seems likely that Robert was seeing the form in the table. He frequently noticed 

symmetries, "cycling," and other patterns in the operation tables, as did all the students. Robert was </table></figure>

formulaically, the verification that it is a homomorphism is an exercise in symbol 

manipulation. Without a formula here, however, the students needed to verify that 

f(a*b) = f(a)*′f(b) Carla and Homomorphisms 

I began the third interview by asking Carla to explain what homomorphism means. She 

gave a reasonably complete definition: 

4 
Carla: Okay. A homomorphism is a function from one group to another, may not be the 
same group, and what makes it a homomorphism is, say, you have a and b in the first 
group. Then f(a*b), which is just whatever function makes that a group, that has the 
same value as f(a)*′f(b), and *′ is the operation that makes the second group a group.

Thus, she was not distinguishing sets from elements; neither was she distinguishing different elements from each other. This issue is discussed further below in the subsection entitled "Wendy and N + N." It is not clear whether Carla saw the partitioning of the domain into subsets as defining the function or as a description of a</head><label></label><figDesc>Several issues are raised by Carla's statements here. First, Carla specified the domain and codomain of the function but not the function itself. From what follows, however, it becomes clear that she was assuming the canonical homomorphism from Z</figDesc><table>, a function that is suggestive of the group operation in Z

mod 
x 
x a 
4 . 

Diane, in her third interview, also specified homomorphisms implicitly in ways that 

suggest that her concept of homomorphism was severely constrained by her concepts of 

function and binary operation. The phenomenon of implicit homomorphisms is explored 

in detail in chapter 7. A related issue is that this particular homomorphism mirrors the 

construction of Z 4 and reflects Carla's understanding of modular arithmetic, which is also 

explored further in chapter 7. 

Finally, in specifying the subsets as 4n, 4n + 1, 4n + 2, and 4n + 3, Carla was taking 

generic values function she had already defined via the ambiguous statement in line 8. 

With either interpretation, and ignoring the seemingly insignificant error in lines 11 and 

12 stating the wrong value of n, by the end of line 12 Carla had given the gist of the 

verification of the homomorphism property for a specific case. I asked her whether she 

had proven that it was a homomorphism. 

14 
Carla: No, this is an example of…. If I was told…. Well, this isn't proving that it is a 
homomorphism, it's just saying that…. It's an example of why it is a homomorphism.

time. So that convinces me that this is indeed a homomorphism" (line 109). He was able 

to explain how specific verifications were represented in the table. And he again 

demonstrated a geometric perspective with his observation, "You could take this table 

and stick it right on top of the other one, and you have the identical table" (line 124). 

Lori, in contrast, decided on her own to use operation tables to verify that the function 

was a homomorphism, although she stated ahead of time that she was not sure she 

remembered how to do it. As it turned out, she applied the method incorrectly so that 

both her tables recorded f(a)*f(b), making equality automatic even if the function had not 

been a homomorphism. When I pressed her to describe the process, she believed that that 

she was computing both f(a*b) and f(a)*f(b). 

I constructed another function that was not a homomorphism and asked Lori to check 

whether it was a homomorphism. Much of the rest of the interview was spent trying to 

help her make explicit connections among the specific pairs a, b that she checked by 

hand, the results that she had recorded in her two tables, and the results in a third table 

that I suggested. By comparing the three different tables, she was able to see what was

This is the first indication of unusual language. It became clear as the interview 

progressed that Lori was calling the collection of cosets "the whole coset." Because she 

had not completed the calculations, she did not yet know what the whole coset was. 

Diane had earlier predicted that there would be two cosets (line 82). Here she called 

them "elements of the coset," demonstrating language similar to Lori's. Diane was also 

predicting here that calculations with any of the flips would yield the same "element." 

Diane computed (23)H, and Lori computed (13)H, and they got the same result, {(12), 

(13), (23)}, though Lori did not include braces. I asked Lori how she had computed the 

coset. 

134 Lori: Um, I took the element, the cycle (13) in D 3 , and I multiplied it by the set [the 
subgroup] to get this coset. 

137 Lori: For the whole left coset, it's going to be this [H] and this [(13)H], and that's it.

That's one left coset right there. 173 Diane: Wait a minute, so this is a left coset, and this is a left coset, and together they make the left coset? So there is one … Diane was uncomfortable with my suggestion because adopting it would have been confusing alongside her language. Apparently, she had not noticed the ambiguity in Lori's language, for she was describing Lori's usage. Lori, on the other hand, was perfectly comfortable with this ambiguity. 181 Lori: Yeah, that was what I was going to say. There's six left cosets because every single element in D 3 is going to produce a different left coset.</head><label>172</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>So there is actually six left cosets

the same, and then all of the stationary ones, or whatever you want to call them, are the

So it's only one set. 

Lori was focusing on the fact that there were six coset calculations, but because some of 

them were the same, the result was two cosets. Then the two cosets together, collected as 

a set, were called one left coset. Diane continued to insist that H was an element, not a 

coset: "This whole set here is one element" (line 187). Furthermore, she did not like 

Lori's claim of six cosets. Because the sameness of the results of the calculations, there 

really were only two sets.

because it's the same doesn't mean that it's still not one. It is a coset; I just didn't write 
it. That's what I was trying to say. 

Thus, Lori was comfortable with the standard language for an individual coset. But after 

completing the calculations and collecting the cosets, she explained, "There is only one

238 Diane: Yeah, I think we are having trouble with vocabulary [Okay] because I am thinking

And I can operate them on the right with the elements in the set and have the left cosets.</figDesc><table>370 Brad: But now let's just say we could design a function that would be a homomorphism 
and had the kernel as this thing that I have said here. The kernel would be 3, 6, 9, and 0. 
Let's say we could set up a homomorphism from…. You know, I am not even going to 
tell you what group we are going to. We are going to send it from Z 12 to some other 
group-I am not telling you what-but the kernel of that's going to be this set {3, 6, 9, 0}. 

371 Robert: And then you want me to find cosets. 

My suggestion was sufficient, for Robert then calculated the cosets quickly. 

Furthermore, by noticing patterns and making and revising conjectures during the 

calculations, he decided, without doing all of the calculations, that there would be only 

three cosets. Robert also 114 Robert: All right. So I take any…. I got to know which things…. See, I am still not sure 
about the coset thing. You…. When you talk about h being in H, you are talking about 
things in the kernel, right? 

115 Brad: Well, in order to be talking about the kernel what do you need? 

116 Robert: A homomorphism. 

117 Brad: Do we have a homomorphism here? 

118 Robert: No. I think that this means I can just take…. I can take all of these elements …

Wendy: Well, we can take the generator group now, and we can find cosets a lot more 
easy because if you take … 4x … every element … every multiple of 4 is going to get 
mapped to 0 in x So the cosets are 
going to be 4x. Okay. 4x + 1, 4x + 2, and 4x + 3, because 4x + 4 is just going to be [the 
same as 4x].

When I asked her how to compute {1, 2, 3} + {1, 2, 3}, she did not remember at first how to do it but eventually decided that the sum would be {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. She was not happy with the result, however, because it did not+ N = N. I suggested that 8x looked more like</head><label></label><figDesc>120 Wendy: You are adding the same set together, so it is going to be the same set. You know like…. If you add two of the same sets together you are just going to get all elements … the same elements in the set.</figDesc><table>Like if you add 1, 2, 3 … the set of {1, 2, 3} 
and the set of {1, 2, 3} you are still going to have the set {1, 2, 3}. Your elements aren't 
going to change any? Wendy saw N fit her expectations. 

134 Wendy: But if you add any multiple of 4 and any multiple of 4, you're going to get 
another multiple of 4. 

136 Wendy: So in this case it's different. So I know that it looks like. I was like, oh well that 
disproves what we are saying here, but it doesn't because … 

137 Brad: So then is it right to say 4x + 4x = 8x? Is it right to even call it this thing 2N? 

138 Wendy: Well, 4x…. You can say 4x + 4x. I don't know about this [Crosses out 2N + 1 ≡ 
N + 1]. But if you say 4x + 1 + 4x, you are going to get 8x + 1, which is going to be 
congruent to…. This is still a multiple of 4, so it is still going to be equal to-congruent 
to; I don't want to say equal to-a multiple of 4, plus 1, which is what N + 1 is. 

Wendy clearly had some thinking that was not reflected in the symbols. Furthermore, she 

had not understood what I was implying by my question about whether 4x + 4x = 8x was 

an appropriate calculation to verify that N multiples of 8, not multiples of 4. 

140 Wendy: That's true, it doesn't include every multiple of 4. But we're talking about mod 
4. And if you are talking about mod 4, we got this because it is 4x + 4x. All right? So if 
you have a multiple of 4 here and a multiple of 4 here, and then you add one, it is still 
going to be…. If you add two multiples…. Like, if you add…. 8's a multiple of 4, and 
8's a multiple of 4, and that equals 16. 16 is still a multiple of 4. 

141 Brad: Do the two multiples of 4 have to be the same in this way you are writing 4x + 4x? 

142 Wendy: No. 8 + 12, okay? That equals 20 and that is still a multiple of 4, so I don't 
think so. 

143 Brad: Okay, so…. But now does the way you have written it, 4x + 4x, does that handle 
both of these cases? When they are the same and when they are different? 

144 Wendy: Uh huh. 

Thus, Wendy's work with the symbols depended upon her thinking. Furthermore, she 

did not see a need to distinguish notationally between the two multiples of 4. I pursued 

this directly in her notation. </table></figure>

152 Wendy: Plus y. So, all right. This explains it better. Do you see why this explains it 
better? 

It did not take much intervention to get Wendy to distinguish between the two multiples 

of 4, but even after she had made the distinction, her symbolic moves were problematic, 

suggesting that there were not yet strong connections between her thinking and the 

symbols. From this point on, however, her symbolic reasoning improved dramatically: 

154 Wendy: If you have a multiple of 4 and a multiple of, another multiple of 4, but where 
they're not the same multiple of 4, and then…. But this multiple…. This is…. Okay, 
this is N. Like if this is your multiple of 4, you add a multiple of 4, which we are calling 
N, and you are adding it to N + 1, you have another multiple of 4, + 1. Okay? But 
because it is not necessarily the same … like this isn't necessarily 8, and this isn't 
necessarily 9. They are not necessarily consecutive numbers. You have to have different 
values for x So, we can, because they have a common factor, we can pull it 
out. [Writes 4(x + y) + 1.]

the function. And you are saying that here g In this excerpt, Diane's language is particularly curious and hard to understand. The 

explanation lies in her concepts of function, homomorphism, group operation, and the 

interaction between them. It became clear later in the interview that Diane's 

understanding of function was based largely on a metaphor of "sending over," which, in 

this excerpt, forms half of Diane's distinction in line 35. Regarding her concept of 

homomorphism, this excerpt reinforces the proposition that, for Diane, the groups

Under addition it probably will be a group; it will be a group.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="127"> Wendy: Well, I was just kind of looking. Cause 4 isn&apos;t an element of Z 6 , element of Z 3. So therefore it wouldn&apos;t be closed. But the problem are these elements right here: 3, 3 and 4, and 4. So like if you looked at Z 2 , it is going to consist of these first two elements. The problem here again is going to be this last multiplication, or addition of 1 and 1,</note>

No matter what group of order 4 you make a table of, it&apos;s going to be congruent to one of these four after renaming them and reordering, I think. Based on this knowledge, they tended to fill in tables based on the patterns and sometimes provided justification for their actions. At the start of the interview, however, they were skeptical as to whether any of their tables were &quot;similar&quot; or &quot;congruent&quot; to each other. Nonetheless, they proceeded to rename and reorder tables, eventually showing, correctly, that three were isomorphic. I asked them what they thought about the three tables that they had shown to be isomorphic. 411 Diane: I think they are the same table. They could be the same table. Like they came from the same abstract table. 413 Diane: Well, I mean, just because you rename and reorder something doesn&apos;t change what it means, what it defines. Like you can call number 1 a, you can call it whatever you want to, but it still stays number 1.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="146"> Lori: You do kind of have to distinguish that these are all one when you multiply it by these elements, and that these are all one, like Diane did. [She adds parentheses.] 147 Brad: Okay. So explain your notation here?</note>

			<note place="foot" n="115"> Wendy: All right. So, you are going to have, if you have 4N…. 4x plus, because N = 4x. It&apos;s going to equal 8x. All right? And 8x is congruent to 4x, which is congruent to 0 mod 4. So this is congruent to N. 116 Wendy: So N is…. You can tell here that N is the identity element. So, you know that … [inaudible] when you add N plus, and N + 1 you are going to get 2N + 1 and that&apos;s going to give you…. That&apos;s the same thing, that is congruent to N + 1.

Where do the things a live? 179 Robert: I believe they live in Z 4 , but I am not sure. That&apos;s one thing I&apos;m really not sure about. 180 Brad: And where do the things h live? 181 Robert: h live in U 8. The h live in U 8 ? 182 Brad: Is that a problem? You are talking about multiplying a thing in Z 4 by a thing in U 8 , or operating on, somehow. 184 Robert: Yeah that&apos;s a problem, isn&apos;t it? Well, so maybe a lives in U 8 too. I mean, this is, H is the kernel of U 8 , which is 1 and 3. I am pretty sure of that. So a could be the things living in U 8 , and if they were, then we would be multiplying 1 times the set of {1, 3, 5, 7}. And 3 times {1, 3, 5, 7}.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="142"> Carla: Well it depends on what we are dealing with. Are we dealing with permutations or sets or what? Or just integers, or …? Carla had freed herself from the example we had been working with, which implies that her earlier statement that f(a) = f(b) required some specifications about f, a, b, and K. But she wanted to attach her thinking to something. 143 Brad: Well, let&apos;s say we want to try think of it sort of in the abstract, independent of any particular representation. Okay? And let&apos;s say we have some element of aK. 144 Carla: All right. If it&apos;s an element of aK, it&apos;s also…. Well you know that k is in the group, because it&apos;s in the kernel. So if it&apos;s in the kernel it has to be in the group. You know that a is in the group because when we do left cosets we take elements from the group, and since the group is closed ak is going to represent an element of the group. 146 Carla: I don&apos;t know if that is answering your question. So Carla took k to be in the kernel, just as she had assumed f to be a homomorphism, suggesting that notational conventions supported her thinking in implicit ways that might have been hard for her to articulate.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="105"> Carla: Well, the thing that it has to do with is that this table is a demonstration of the group of those three sets-that they are a group. 109 Carla: The normal part of it just says that you got it because you had left and right cosets that were equal to each other.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="202"> Carla: Because any subgroup has to have the identity, so that&apos;s (1). That&apos;s why (1) is in there. And then if you…. And (12) obviously has to be in there because it&apos;s generated by it. So if you operated (1) on (12) you just get (12). So it&apos;s in there so we are all set. And (12) operated with (12) just gives you (1). Another way you can think of it is that the order of (12) is 2. So if you call alpha (12), then the subgroup is only going contain alpha to the 0 and alpha to the 1.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="324"> Brad: Before you said that normal had something…. You used the word normal as having something to do with when the left cosets and the right cosets are the same. 325 Carla: Yeah. But I wasn&apos;t right on that &apos;cause that was quotient group.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="144"> Diane: And, well, here you have the function g. I should put g here. And then you take your two elements and put them through g and you get an element here in Z 4. So if you do it on the other side of the homomorphism, you take a here send it through the function and get your element, send b through the function and get your element, and then you put them together in Z 4. 146 Diane: We could take like g and 3 times 1. And in U 8 , 3×1 = 3, and g(3) is 3. And g of…. I don&apos;t think I did what I said I&apos;m supposed to do. I think I sent this over to get g(3) in Z 4 is 3 and 3 star 1… In her description of the process, it appears Diane saw g(a*b) and g(a)*g(b) as two sides of the homomorphism, suggesting that the defining formula for a homomorphism was the homomorphism itself. Furthermore, in evaluating g(3), Diane ignored my definition of g altogether and instead decided that g(3) was 3.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="115"> Lori: Oh, I said that if-it&apos;s wrong now-but I said that if, f(1) before it was sent is in the domain, and then after it&apos;s sent, it&apos;s 0, and it&apos;s in the codomain. [Okay.] That&apos;s wrong. 1 is in the domain, and f(1) is in the codomain, and f(1) evaluated in the codomain is 0. 121 Lori: 1 is before it&apos;s sent, f(1) is after it&apos;s sent, and 0 is after it&apos;s sent.</note>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Math 761</head><p>Midterm exam #1</p><p>Please record your answers and their explanations on a separate sheet of paper. This sheet is yours to keep.</p><p>You may, if necessary, use the fact(s) that the sets Z, Q, R, and C (the integers, rational numbers, real numbers and complex numbers) are groups under addition, and the nonzero elements of Q, R, and C, respectively, form multiplicative groups. a) e is an identity of the set S under the operation 񮽙.</p><p>b) The operation 񮽙 is associative on the set S.</p><p>c) The operation 񮽙 is commutative on the set S.</p><p>e) The set S is a group under the operation 񮽙.   </p><p>Fill out all possible operation tables which make the set {e, a, b, c} a group. You may assume that e is the identity of each group. In the process, be sure to explain your decisions and prove that the set is a group under each of the specified operations. You may use the computer to check the associative property, but you must justify all of the other properties "by hand". You don't have to provide a formula for the operation, but explain each decision you make while filling out the table. For example, explain how we know that the first row and column is the same for each possible table. What are the possibilities for a 2 ? Are there any that don't work (that is, that won't allow the set to be a group)? In a particular table, once you've "chosen" a 2 , does this "force" some (or all) of the other values in the table? Why can't we have bc = b? Is it possible to fill out the table so that the set is a nonabelian group?</p><p>3. Recall that the funny addition operation 񮽙 on the set R of real numbers is defined by a񮽙b = a+b+ab. Show that 񮽙 satisfies the associative property . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Number Theory</head><p>Abstract algebra has roots in number theory, in geometry, and in methods of solving equa- tions. The first few assignments are designed to explore these roots. Perhaps the most famous number theory problem is Fermat's last theorem 1 (or, more accurately, Fermat's conjecture) which states that there are no non-trivial 2 integer solutions to the equation x n + y n = z n when n is an integer greater than 2. Investigation of this question alone has led to incredible achievements in the development of the fields of algebra, number theory, and algebraic geometry. We cannot consider the question here, but instead consider related questions.</p><p>1. Euler proved in 1770 that x 3 + y 3 = z 3 has no non-trivial integral solutions. In order to gain an understanding of this problem, we might first ask whether x 3 + y 3 is ever divisible by 3? If so, what can you conclude about x and y. If not, why not?</p><p>Hint: A useful way to explore this equation is through modular arithmetic, sometimes called arithmetic of remainders. We say a ≡ b mod n if a and b have the same remainder when divided by n. For example, 3 ≡ 24 mod 7 because both have a remainder of 3 when divided by 7.</p><p>2. Investigate solving equations of the form ax ≡ b mod n for n = 5 and n = 6, where a and b are constants. For example, does 3x ≡ 5 mod 6 have a solution? Try several different values of a and b. Be sure that you have found ALL solutions. Summarize your results.</p><p>3. Investigate a + x ≡ b mod n for n = 5 and n = 6. 4. Investigate x 2 + 3x + 2 ≡ 0 mod n for n = 5 and n = 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Arithmetic with sets</head><p>1. If A = {1, 3, 4} and B = {2, 6}, can 1. Read pages 3-4, omitting the last paragraph of page 4, and pages 7-9 (on modular arithmetic). In particular, carefully read through the proof of the Division Algorithm (on page 4) until you feel that you'd be able to explain it to someone else. (a) Rewrite the proof of the division algorithm, being sure to fill in all of the details that you feel are missing. (b) Explain the Well-Ordering Principle, in a way that a high school student would understand.</p><p>2. Work through problem #2 from the first handout. Compare the cases n = 5 and n = 6, using at least 4 different choices for a and b. State a conjecture based on what you find. Are there generalizations that seem to be true for all n, a, and b?</p><p>3. Work through problem #3 from the handout. Compare the cases n = 5 and n = 6, using at least 4 different choices for a and b. State a conjecture based on what you find. Are there generalizations that seem to be true for all n, a, and b?</p><p>4. Work through problem #4 from the handout. Compare the cases n = 5 and n = 6, State a conjecture based on what you find. Are there generalizations that seem to be true for all n?</p><p>5. Investigate the values of n 3 (mod 6). Make and prove a conjecture based on your "data".</p><p>6. Do #27 on page 19 of the textbook. Explain how you know you've found all n that satisfy the specified condition.</p><p>7. Work on, but don't turn in. Prove that x 3 + y 3 is divisible by 3 if and only if x + y is divisible by 3.</p><p>Read the rest of pp. 3-13 (up to, but not including, equivalence relations).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition of group (and its consequences)</head><p>As we defined in class, a set S, along with an operation 񮽙, is a group if the following properties are satisfied:</p><p>1. For all a and b in S, a 񮽙 b is in S.</p><p>We then say that S is closed under the operation 񮽙.</p><p>2. For all a, b, and c in S, (a 񮽙 b) 񮽙 c = a 񮽙 (b 񮽙 c).</p><p>We then say that 񮽙 is associative on S.</p><p>3. There exists an element e in S so that e 񮽙 a = a 񮽙 e = a for each a in S. We then say that e is the identity element of S.</p><p>4. For each a in S, there is an element a -1 in S so that a 񮽙 a -1 = a -1 񮽙 a = e (where e is the identity element of S). We say that a -1 is the inverse of a in S.</p><p>Problems for group discussion:</p><p>1. Determine whether the subset {2,4,6,8} of Z 10 is a group under multiplication (in Z 10 ).</p><p>In earlier problems with operation tables, we noticed that in some rows and columns of some tables, not all elements of the set occurred. For example, consider the multiplication table for Z <ref type="bibr">10</ref> . Several of the rows and columns have repeated elements, so some elements have to be left out; for example, 1 is not in the "2 row".</p><p>2. In an earlier problem, you were asked to determine whether ab = ac implies b = c for a variety of sets and associated operations. Is this cancellation law true for groups? That is, if S is a group under the operation 񮽙 and a 񮽙 b = a 񮽙 c, then is it necessarily true that b = c? In other words, is it possible to cancel the a from both sides of the equation?</p><p>3. The above version of the cancellation law is often called the left cancellation law, since the a is canceled on the left. Determine whether the right cancellation law is true for groups.</p><p>4. What do the right and left cancellation laws imply about whether the rows and columns in a group's operation table have any repeated elements?</p><p>5. Show that each row and column in a group's operation table contains every group element exactly once. For example, to show that the element c occurs in the "a row", we need to show that the equation a 񮽙 x = c has a solution in the group. Show that this is true, explain why it shows that c is in the "a row", and show that c also occurs in the "a column".</p><p>6. Suppose that (S, 񮽙) is a group with identity e. If a 񮽙 x = a for some a and x in S , what can you conclude about x? What if x 񮽙 a = a ? That is, what kinds of elements can act like an identity in a group?</p><p>7. How many inverses can an element in a group have? That is, if a is an element of a group S with operation 񮽙 and identity e, and if x 񮽙 a = e or a 񮽙 x = e, what can you conclude about x?</p><p>8. If S is a group with operation 񮽙 and identity e, and a and b are elements of S so that a -1 = b -1 , what can you conclude about a and b?</p><p>Additional terminology: Let S be a group under the operation 񮽙. If a 񮽙 b = b 񮽙 a for all a and b in S, then we say that 񮽙 is commutative on S and that S is an abelian group. If S is not abelian, we say that S is nonabelian.</p><p>9. Show that the "mixed" cancellation law is true for abelian groups. That is, prove that if the groups, with operation 񮽙, is abelian and if a 񮽙 b = c 񮽙 a, then a = c.</p></div>

Sit down at one of the IBM clones (one of the planets) in the M227 computer lab. If the machine isn't on, turn it on. If the screen saver is on, "jiggle" the mouse.</p><p>(Note: if you're working on Jupiter, you might need to press the spacebar in order to "wake it up".)</p><p>2. Start up Exploring Small Groups. If you're in Windows, double-click the "Groups" icon in the Mathematics Software folder.</p><p>If you're in DOS, type cd ..\math\groups\esg followed by &lt;RETURN&gt; (or &lt;Enter&gt;), then type start followed by &lt;RETURN&gt;. If this doesn't work, type esg then &lt;RETURN&gt;. 3. At some point, it will be good to read the information provided when you start up the program, but today, we'll hit &lt;RETURN&gt; until we're at the <ref type="table">Table Generation</ref> Menu, which I'll usually refer to as the Main Menu. From the Main Menu, we can choose to create our own operation table, or use one of the "canned" tables which the software "knows". If you want to exit the program, you need to get back to this menu. In order to do that, hit the F10 button until the computer asks you if you want to return to the table generation menu. Type y and you will be back at this menu. You can then type 5 to exit the program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.</head><p>We'll first try some of the tables the software already knows. Type 34 then &lt;RETURN&gt; to see the "commutative loop".</p><p>The operation table now appears before you, along with a variety of commands that you can use. Your screen should look something like: </p></div>

Sometimes, you've got to hit the spacebar (or some other button) to continue. In addition, you often have the choice of stepping through various calculations. For example, let's check to see if the associative law holds for the set {A, B, C, D, E, F} (notice that it's not too hard to see that the set is closed under the operation, that A is the identity of the set, and that A -1 = A, B -1 = F, C -1 = C, D -1 = D, E -1 = E, and F -1 = B).</p></div>

By the definition of S a , we know that an element X is in S a if and only if X = aga-1 for some g in G. With this in mind, let&apos;s proceed. First, let&apos;s show that the identity of G is in S a. That is, if e is the identity of G, we need to find a g in G so that e = aga-1. How can we find such a g? Let&apos;s work backwards. Suppose we had found g. Then we&apos;d know that e = aga-1 , so we can solve for g by &quot;multiplying&quot; (actually, we&apos;re 񮽙-ing) by a-1 and a on the left and right sides of each equation. Therefore, a-1 ea = a-1 (aga-1 )a = (a-1 a)g(a-1 a) = ege = g, so we&apos;ve found that g = a-1 ea = e. But by solving for g</title>
